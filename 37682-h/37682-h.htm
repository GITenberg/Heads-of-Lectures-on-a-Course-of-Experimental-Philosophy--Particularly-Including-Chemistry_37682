<h2><a name="THE_PREFACE" id="THE_PREFACE"></a>THE PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Situated, as I happily am, in the neighbourhood of the <i>New College at
Hackney</i>, an institution that does honour to the Dissenters, an
institution open to all persons without distinction<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
and connected as I am by friendship with the tutors, I was glad to give
it every assistance in my power; and therefore undertook to read the
<i>Lectures on History and General Policy</i> which I had composed when I was
tutor at Warrington, and also to give another course on the subject of
<i>Experimental Philosophy</i>. With this view I drew up the following <i>Heads
of Lectures</i>; and, to save the students the trouble of transcribing
them, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
now printed. To other persons they may serve as a compendious view of
the most important discoveries relating to the subject.</p>

<p>As it was found most convenient, with respect to the other business of
the college, to confine this course to one lecture in a week, I
contrived to bring within that compass as much of the subject of
experimental philosophy as I well could, and especially to include the
whole of what is called <i>chemistry</i>, to which so much attention is now
given, and which presents so many new fields of philosophical
investigation.</p>

<p>Besides that the plan of the young gentlemen's studies would not admit
of it, I think it most advisable not to trouble beginners with more than
a large outline of any branch of science. By this means they are not
fatigued by too long an attention to any one subject, a greater variety
of articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
may be brought before them, and in future life they may pursue any of
them as much farther as their inclination may dispose, and their ability
and opportunity shall enable, them to do it.</p>

<p>I do not give any account of the <i>experiments</i> introduced into the
several lectures. They will be sufficiently indicated by the subjects of
them. They were as many as I could conveniently make within the time;
and where the experiments themselves could not be made, I usually
exhibited both the different substances employed in them, and those that
were the result of them.</p>

<p>As these lectures were calculated for the use of the students at the New
College, I prefix an <i>Address to them</i>, the same in substance with that
which I delivered to them at the close of the session of 1791. In it may
be seen a specimen of the language we hold to them on the subject of
<i>politics</i>, which with reasonable men will serve as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
answer to the many calumnies that have been thrown out against us, as
disaffected to the government of this country.</p>

<p>Such institutions will, indeed, always be objects of hatred and dread to
<i>bigots</i> and the advocates for <i>arbitrary power</i>, but the pride of a
truly <i>free country</i>. I therefore conclude with my earnest prayer (the
accomplishment of which the present state of the College does not allow
us to doubt) <span class="smcap">Esto perpetua</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DEDICATION" id="THE_DEDICATION"></a>THE DEDICATION.</h2>

<p class="center">TO THE STUDENTS AT THE NEW COLLEGE IN HACKNEY.</p>

<p>My young Friends,</p>

<p>Having drawn up the following <i>Heads of Lectures</i> for your use, I take
the liberty thus publickly to dedicate them to you; and as I earnestly
wish for your improvement and happiness in all respects, excuse me if I
take the farther liberty of making a few observations, and giving you
some advice, of a more general nature, adapted to your age and
circumstances.</p>

<p>As you will soon leave this place of education, and enter upon your
several professions and employments, I hope your conduct will
demonstrate to the world the solid advantages of this institution, and
that the great expence attending it, and the best attention of the
managers, have not been bestowed in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Many liberal friends of science, of virtue, and of religion, have
contributed to procure you the advantages which you enjoy. They have
spared no pains to provide able and careful tutors, and you have had
every other advantage for the prosecution of your studies that they
could procure you, unclogged by any subscription to articles of faith,
or obligation of any other kind, besides such as they have deemed
necessary for your own good, and to give the institution its greatest
effect. This is an advantage you could not have found elsewhere, at
least in this country. And in every seminary of education much more
depends upon opportunity for study, free from any obstruction, and undue
bias, than upon the ability of tutors; though there is an additional
advantage when they are able men, and eminent in the branches of science
which they undertake to teach. But this is by no means so essential as
many other circumstances.</p>

<p>Whatever be the qualifications of your tutors, your improvement must
chiefly depend upon yourselves. They cannot <i>think</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
or <i>labour</i> for you. They can only put you in the best way of thinking
and labouring for yourselves. If, therefore, you get knowledge, you must
acquire it by your own industry. You must form all conclusions, and all
maxims, for yourselves, from premises and <i>data</i> collected, and
considered by yourselves. And it is the great object of this institution
to remove every bias the mind can lie under, and give the greatest scope
to true freedom of thinking and inquiry. And provided you be intelligent
and virtuous men, and good citizens, it will be no cause of regret to
the friends of this institution, if, with respect to <i>religion</i>, or
<i>politics</i>, you adopt systems of principles, and maxims of conduct, very
different from theirs.</p>

<p>Give me leave, now that I am addressing you as <i>young men</i>, and young
<i>students</i>, to suggest a caution on a subject, of the importance of
which it is hardly possible that you should be sufficiently aware,
because it is only impressed by that <i>experience</i> which you have not yet
had. I mean that degree of vanity which generally accompanies the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
acquirements that diligent persons of your age make in places of liberal
education, and the contempt they are too apt to entertain for those who
have not made the same proficiency with themselves. And I assure you,
that in the observations I shall make on this subject, I have no view
whatever to any thing that I have observed, or heard, of any of you in
particular. But I have been in your situation myself, and I know the
importance of these observations to students in general.</p>

<p>You are now at an age in which young persons usually make the most
sensible advances in knowledge, and in which the understanding appears
to ripen the most rapid manner. You are able to say every year, every
month, and almost every day, what particular advances you have made, and
how much you know more than you did before. And being taught, and
accustomed, to express your thoughts in writing, you find yourselves
qualified to do this in a manner of which you had no idea, or
expectation, but a little time ago. You also perfectly remember what you
have so recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
learned, and many respects may be more particular and exact than even
your tutors themselves.</p>

<p>The almost unavoidable effect of this is a high idea of your own powers
and attainments, and too often a proportionable contempt of those who,
not having had equal advantages, cannot do what you are easily capable
of. A certain degree of vanity is, therefore, excusable in young
persons; and, indeed, it is by means of it that they are excited to
exert themselves in a manner that they would not otherwise have done.
But be careful that this temper be not indulged to excess, for it will
then be found to have serious ill consequences; the least of which is
the precluding future improvement, from being already satisfied with
yourselves, and conscious of a sufficient superiority over others.</p>

<p>The foundation of this self-conceit, on account of literary attainments,
will be found to be extremely weak. In fact, we learn more before the
period to which you are now arrived, and I hope you will continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
to learn more after it, without its being so much noticed; and the
<i>ability</i> that is discovered in the acquirements which are the subjects
of this vanity is not greater than appears on other occasions. Only they
are not so conspicuous.</p>

<p>What we all learn in the first three years of our lives, is much more
extraordinary in its nature than all that we acquire afterwards. I mean
the perfect use of our limbs, and the elements of speech. What we learn
in a month in that early period of life, could not, if we were brought
up in the ignorance of it, be learned in a year at any subsequent
period. But these acquirements being universal, and what the
circumstances in which we are all necessarily in compel us to learn, it
does not appear extraordinary in any particular individual. Also, the
proficiency that boys make at a grammar school, in which, in general,
the dead languages only are taught (a knowledge of which is commonly the
result of severe application) is too common to be the cause of much
self-conceit. But the advances that are made at places of liberal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
education are both less common, and of a more conspicuous nature.</p>

<p>You will also find, if you continue your application to study, that it
is only the elements of science that you can acquire here, and that if
you live many years, they will bear but a small proportion to your
future acquirements. But those future acquirements, in consequence of
their bearing a less proportion to your whole stock of knowledge, will
not be so conspicuous. Thus, though all the buildings that in one year
are added to such a city as London would make a pretty large country
town, they bear so small a proportion to what was built before, that
they are not much noticed; whereas, had half the quantity of building
been erected in a place where no house had existed before, it would have
been a memorable event in the history of the country.</p>

<p>Also, as in old cities many buildings will fall to decay, while new ones
are added; you must expect to forget much of what you now know. No man
can give equal attention to every object; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
as we advance in life, we, in general, only learn new things at the
expence of the old ones. But then they are the more valuable articles of
knowledge, the more general and leading principles, which remain with
us; while the more useless ones, things to which we give less attention
because we find them to be of less use, disappear. Yet it is no uncommon
thing for ingenious students to despise old scholars who are not so
ready in the <i>minutiæ</i> of literature, though they may have forgotten
more than those youths ever knew, and may retain what they cannot
acquire without forgetting as much.</p>

<p>Another observation proper to lessen the conceit of literary men, is,
that genius is not confined to <i>them</i>, but is equally great, though not
equally conspicuous, in every other line of life, and especially in
manufactures and the arts. Here, however, discoveries equal, with
respect to <i>sagacity</i>, to those of Newton, contribute little to
posthumous fame, because the discoverers are not writers.</p>

<p>But the greatest branch of intellectual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
excellence with respect to which every other is nothing, and which, from
its nature, can never be foundation of any self-conceit, is <i>virtue</i>, or
right dispositions of mind, leading to right conduct in life. Proper
sentiments, and just affections of mind, arise from just, and often
comprehensive, views of things, past, present, and to come. And if the
real greatness of any thought, or action, be estimated by the number of
elements that constitute it, and its remoteness from the dictates of
sense and natural appetite, a virtuous and pious man will appear to be a
much more dignified character, more proper to be viewed with admiration
and esteem, than the greatest scholar; discovering, in fact, greater
comprehension and force of mind. I mean, however, that virtue which is
the result of reflection, of discipline, and much voluntary exertion,
which, though operating with equal promptness and facility, is as much
superior to mere <i>innocence</i>, and what is commonly called <i>good nature</i>,
as motions secondarily automative are to those that are primarily so; a
comparison which you who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
have studied <i>Hartley's Theory of the Mind</i> will see the force of.</p>

<p>These considerations I take the liberty to suggest, as being proper to
lessen that vanity which is so incident to those who distinguish
themselves in the fields of literature, and which, operating like the
acquisition of riches, or power, or any possession that is <i>rare</i> among
men, instead of enlarging, may tend to contract the mind, by confining
its attention to itself. Beginning with a generous emulation, it
proceeds to envy and jealousy, and ends in actual hatred and malignity,
against which you cannot, surely, be too strongly put upon your guard;
this being the greatest depravity to which human nature is subject, and
which yet, like any other vice, may be in full possession of the mind,
without the person himself knowing, or suspecting it; unless he give
more attention to his feelings than most persons do. If no man ever
thought himself to be avaricious, or cruel, can it be expected that any
person should ever discover that he is too self-conceited?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
Better, however, infinitely better, were it to rank with the merest
dunces, than have the conceit and malignity (produced originally from
conceit) of some who have distinguished themselves the most as
linguists, critics, and poets. Even the study of nature, though, from
its vast extent, it is less apt to produce this baneful effect, is not
always a sufficient guard against it. This is an affecting and an
alarming consideration. But in the intellectual, as in the civil and
commercial world, we gain nothing but at the risk of some loss; and in
this case the possible gain is worth the risk of even this great loss.</p>

<p>For when literary, and scientific excellence coincide with that which is
of a moral nature, it adds unspeakably to the value of a character.
Ingenuity coupled with modesty, and great genius with benevolence and
true piety, constitute the perfection of human character, and is what we
should ever have in view. And a course of education in which both these
objects are equally attended to, is the only one that deserves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
to be called <i>liberal</i>: but such as, I hope, you have found this to be.</p>

<p>Give me leave further to observe to you, that the time that you spend in
a place of liberal education is of more importance to you than you can
be at present aware of. Whatever be the sphere of life for which you are
destined, the probability is, that you will hereafter have but little
leisure for reading and studying, compared to what you have now.
Besides, general maxims of all kinds, such as are the foundation of all
our future conduct, in morals, religion, or politics, are generally
formed at your time of life. From this period expect no great change in
your opinions, or conduct; because now it is that you give particular
attention to the forming your opinions on all subjects of importance; so
that very little that is materially new to you can be expected to occur
to you in future life, and almost every thing that you would choose to
read will only tend to confirm you in the general principles that you
will now adopt. There are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
no doubt, exceptions to this, as well as every other general
observation; but it is wisdom to suppose, and to act upon the
supposition, that we are constituted as the generality of mankind are,
and that we shall feel, and act, as they do. Since, then, so much
depends on the leading principles and maxims which you will now adopt,
be it your care to form just and good ones, and let no authority of
tutors, or others, have any undue influence over you. In all cases think
and judge for yourselves, and especially on all subjects of importance,
and with as much attention as you can give to them.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss, in the present state of things, to say something
respecting another subject, which now commands universal attention. You
cannot but be apprised, that many persons entertain a prejudice against
this College, on account of the republican, and, as they choose to call
them, the licentious, principles of government, which are supposed to be
taught here. Show, then, by your general conversation, and conduct, that
you are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
friends of peace and good order; and that, whatever may be your opinions
with respect to the best form of government for people who have no
previous prejudices or habits, you will do every thing in your power for
the preservation of that form of it which the generality of your
countrymen approve, and under which you live, which is all that can be
reasonably expected of any subject. As it is not necessary that every
good son should think his parent the wisest and best man in the world,
but it is thought sufficient if the son pay due respect and obedience to
his parent; so neither is it to be expected that every man should be of
opinion that the form of government under which he happens to be born is
the best of all possible forms of government. It is enough that he
submit to it, and that he make no attempt to bring about any change,
except by fair reasoning, and endeavouring to convince his countrymen,
that it is in their power to better their condition in that respect, as
well as in any other. Think, therefore, speak, and write, with the
greatest freedom on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
subject of government, particular or general, as well as on any other
that may come before you. It can only be avowed tyranny that would
prevent this. But at the same time submit yourselves, and promote
submission in others, to that form of government which you find to be
most approved, in this country, which at present unquestionably is that
by <i>King, Lords, and Commons</i>.</p>

<p>As to <i>religion</i>, we may, surely, be allowed to think and act entirely
for ourselves; in all cases obeying God and conscience rather than man.
But let us be thankful for the degree of liberty that we are allowed,
though it be not all that we are justly entitled to; and let us not use
any other means than reason and argument in order to better our
condition. By this peaceable and steady conduct we shall at length
convince those who will hear reason, that we are entitled to greater
consideration; and doubt not but whatever is <i>true</i> and <i>right</i>, will
finally prevail, and be universally established.</p>

<p>That any of your tutors, or any of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
friends of this institution, wish to promote reformation, in church or
state, by any other means than those of reason, and argument, is a
<i>calumny</i>, utterly void of foundation, or probability. But your conduct,
dispersed as you will soon be in different parts of the country, will be
the best means of refuting it. Let us leave the method of proceeding by
<i>riot</i> and <i>tumult</i> to those persons to whose schemes such proceedings
are congenial. Truth stands in no need of such support, and will always
triumph when assailed by such weapons. In return, then, for the
advantages which you have enjoyed in this institution, do it this
service; and in recommending it, I trust you are doing substantial
service to the cause of liberty and truth; and conferring a most
important benefit on your country, and on mankind.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_I" id="LECTURE_I"></a>LECTURE I.</h2>

<h3><i>The Introduction.</i></h3>

<p>The object of experimental philosophy is the knowledge of nature in
general, or more strictly, that of the properties of natural substances,
and of the changes of those properties in different circumstances. This
knowledge can only be attained by <i>experiment</i>, or <i>observation</i>; as
that clay is capable of becoming hard by means of fire, and thereby
being made into bricks, and that by the same means <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Originally
'limestone'.">lime-stone</span> can be converted into quick-lime, and by
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
addition of water and sand, make mortar. It is by observation also that
we discover that stones and other heavy bodies fall to the ground, and
that a magnet will attract iron. In other words, experimental philosophy
is an investigation of the wisdom of God in the works and <i>the laws of
nature</i>, so that it is one of the greatest objects to the mind of man,
and opens a field of inquiry which has no bounds; every advance we make
suggesting new doubts and subjects of farther inquiry.</p>

<p>The uniformity we discover in the properties of natural substances
enables us to lay down general rules, or principles, which, being
invariable, we call the laws of nature; and by our knowledge of these
laws we are able to predict, and at our own pleasure to produce,
particular results, and this is the source of all the powers of man. It
is the direction we acquire of the powers of nature; so that, as Lord
Bacon observed, <i>knowledge is power</i>.</p>

<p>All arts and manufactures are derived from science. Thus the doctrine of
<i>mechanics</i> is an application of the law of gravitation. Every thing we
are capable of doing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
means of the steam-engine is derived from our knowledge of the
properties of water in steam; all the great effects of gunpowder we owe
to our knowledge of the composition, and chemical properties, of that
substance.</p>

<p>Every new appearance in nature is preceded by some new circumstance, and
to this, or rather to something always attending it, we say that the
appearance is <i>owing</i>. This circumstance we therefore call the <i>cause</i>,
and the new appearance the <i>effect</i> of that cause. Thus we say that the
union of phlogiston to a particular kind of earth is the cause of its
becoming a metal.</p>

<p>It is one of the principal rules of philosophizing to admit no more
causes than are necessary to account for the effects. Thus, if the power
of gravity, by which heavy bodies fall to the earth, be sufficient to
retain the planets in their orbits, we are authorized to reject the
<i>Cartesian Vortices</i>. In other words, we must make no more general
propositions than are necessary to comprehend all the particulars
contained in them. Thus, after having observed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
iron consists of a particular kind of earth united to phlogiston, and
that it is soluble in acids; and that the same is true of all other
metallic substances, we say, universally, that all metals consist of a
peculiar earth and phlogiston, and that they are all soluble in some
acid.</p>

<p>Of the circumstances which occasion a change in the properties of
bodies, some are the addition of what are properly called <i>substances</i>,
or things that are the objects of our senses, being <i>visible</i>,
<i>tangible</i>, or having <i>weight</i>, &amp;c. Thus the addition of an acid
changes an alkali into a neutral salt. But other changes are occasioned
either by a change of texture in the substance itself, or the addition
of something that is not the object of any of our senses. Thus, a piece
of steel becomes a magnet by the touch of another magnet, and a drop of
glass acquires the property of flying asunder by a small fracture, in
consequence of falling when red hot into cold water. Such also, in the
opinion of some, is the difference between hot and cold substances.</p>

<p>Till the nature of the cause be ascertained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
it is convenient to make use of the term <i>principle</i>, as including both
of the above-mentioned causes of the change of properties in bodies.
Thus, whatever be the real cause of gravity, or of inflammability, we
may speak of the <i>principle of gravity</i>, or of <i>inflammability</i>;
whether, with Newton, we suppose gravity to be occasioned by a fluid
pervading the whole universe, which he termed <i>æther</i>, and whether
inflammability be caused by the presence of a real substance called
phlogiston, or not. In this manner we use the letters <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> to
denote unknown quantities in algebra.</p>

<p>When changes are made in substances by the addition of other substances,
they make what is called a <i>chemical union</i>; and in this case the
properties of the compound cannot with any certainty be deduced from
those of the component parts, but must be ascertained by fresh
experiments. Thus, from the specific gravities, or the degrees of
fusibility, of two metals, those of the compound cannot be predicted.
Neither water nor acid of vitriol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
will separately dissolve iron, so as to produce inflammable air, but
both together will do it. However, the properties of similar compounds
are similar to one another. Thus, all metals dissolved in acids are
precipitated by mild alkalis. This chemical union of two substances we
ascribe to a certain <i>elective attraction</i>, or <i>affinity</i> that subsists
between them, in consequence of which they unite with one another
whenever a proper opportunity offers, in preference to those substances
to which they were before united. Thus the vitriolic acid, having a
stronger affinity with the vegetable alkali which is the basis of nitre,
will unite with that alkali, and with it form another compound, called
<i>vitriolated tartar</i>, while the acid of nitre, being detached from its
base, is collected separately.</p>

<p>When two substances compose one liquid, and a third, which has a
stronger affinity with either of the two parts than they have with each
other, is added to them, it will unite with that part, and take its
place in the solution, while the other will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in many cases be precipitated, and may be collected. Thus the earth of
alum is precipitated from a solution of alum by salt of tartar. This is
the case of <i>simple affinity</i>.</p>

<p>When both the substances are compounds, the component parts of which
have a weaker affinity with each other than they have with those of the
other compound, two new combinations are formed, and this is called a
case of <i>double affinity</i>. Thus when phlogisticated alkali is poured
into a solution of green vitriol, the acid of the vitriol unites with
the alkali, while the phlogiston joining the calx of iron makes Prussian
blue.</p>

<p>All nature lying open to our investigation, we must consider the
different parts in some order. But it is not very material which we
adopt, because, begin where we will, the properties of the substances we
first treat of will be connected with those which must be particularly
considered afterwards, the changes in one substance being occasioned by
its union with another. It will be impossible, for example, to explain
the properties of metals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
without considering the <i>acids</i>, because by their union with acids very
important changes are made in their properties.</p>

<p>There have been three principal methods of arranging natural substances.
One is according to the <i>three kingdoms</i>, as they are called, into which
they have been distributed, viz. the <i>mineral</i>, the <i>vegetable</i>, and the
<i>animal</i>. Another is according to the <i>elements</i> which enter into their
composition, and a third according to the <i>form</i> in which they are
usually found, viz. <i>aerial</i>, <i>fluid</i>, or <i>solid</i>. Upon the whole this
last appears to me to be the most convenient, especially as it is easy
to intermix general observations concerning the other divisions when
they are particularly wanted. As there will be frequent occasion to
speak of the component and elementary parts of all substances, I shall
here observe, that, according to the latest observations, the following
appear to be the elements which compose all natural substances, viz.
<i>dephlogisticated air</i>, or the <i>acidifying principle</i>; <i>phlogiston</i>, or
the <i>alkaline principle</i>; the different <i>earths</i>, and the principles of
<i>heat</i>, <i>light</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and <i>electricity</i>. Besides these, there are the following principles
which have not been proved to be substances, viz. <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Comma
inserted"><i>attraction</i>,</span> <i>repulsion</i>, and <i>magnetism</i>. By the help of
these principles we are able, according to the present state of natural
knowledge, to explain all the appearances that have yet occurred to us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_II" id="LECTURE_II"></a>LECTURE II.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Properties of all Matter.</i></h3>

<p>Before I consider the properties of particular substances, it will be
proper to mention those which are common to them all. But I shall first
observe, that the term <i>substance</i> has no proper idea annexed to it, but
is merely a convenience in speech; since we cannot speak of the
properties of substances, such as <i>hard</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>coloured</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
&amp;c. &amp;c. (which circumstances alone affect our senses, and
thereby give proper ideas) without saying that they inhere in, or belong
to, some <i>thing</i>, <i>substance</i>, or <i>substratum</i>. The terms <i>being</i> and
<i>person</i> are also in the same predicament.</p>

<p>One property of all substances is <i>extension</i>, since they all occupy
some portion of space.</p>

<p>The incapacity of any substance to change its place has been termed,
though improperly, the <i>vis inertiæ</i> of matter. It is sufficient to say,
that neither this, nor any other effect can be produced without a cause.</p>

<p><i>Infinite divisibility</i> is a necessary property of all extended
substance; and from this circumstance it will follow, that the smallest
quantity of solid matter may be made to fill the largest space, and yet
none of the pores shall exceed the smallest given magnitude; and
consequently, that, for any thing we know to the contrary, all the
bodies in the universe may be comprized in the smallest space.</p>

<p>Another property usually ascribed to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
matter is <i>impenetrability</i>, or the necessary exclusion of any substance
from the place occupied by another. But the only proof of
impenetrability is the <i>resistance</i> that we find to our endeavours to
put one substance into the place of another; and it is demonstrated by
experiments, that this resistance is not occasioned by the actual
contact of the substances, but by a power of repulsion acting at a real
distance from their surfaces. It requires a considerable force to bring
two solid substances into as near contact as the particles of the same
substance; and that <i>these</i> are not in actual contact is evident, from
their being capable of being brought nearer by cold; and this is most
remarkable with respect to the heaviest, that is, the densest, of all
substances, viz. the metals.</p>

<p>A more positive argument for the penetrability of matter is, that the
particles of light, after entering the densest transparent substance, do
not appear to meet with any obstruction to their progress till they come
to the opposite side.</p>

<p>The powers of <i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i> seem to be common to all
matter, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
component parts of all substances are kept in
their places by the due balance of those opposite powers. If, by any
means, the particles of any substance be removed beyond their sphere of
mutual attraction, they repel one another, as those of water when it
becomes steam.</p>

<p>Of the different kinds of attraction, that of <i>gravitation</i> seems to
extend to the greatest possible distance; but that which keeps together
the parts of the same substance, thence called the <i>attraction of
cohesion</i>, and the different kinds of chemical attractions, called
<i>affinities</i>, only act at a small distance. Of the causes of these
attractions we are entirely ignorant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of Aeriform Substances.</i></h3>

<p>Aeriform substances, of which the air that we breathe is one, though
invisible, are real substances, as appears by their excluding other
substances.</p>

<p>That the air has <i>weight</i> appears by actually weighing a vessel before
and after it is exhausted of air by means of an air-pump (an instrument
contrived for that purpose) by its bursting a bladder, and various other
experiments.</p>

<p>Air, being a fluid, presses in all directions, as in the experiment of
the fountain in <i>vacuo</i>, and others.</p>

<p>The weight of the air is the cause of the suspension of mercury in a
barometer, and of the action of pumps. The weight of atmospherical air
is to that of water in the proportion of about 1 to 800, so as to
press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
with the weight of about fourteen pounds on every square inch of
surface.</p>

<p>Air, being an elastic fluid, is capable of occupying more or less space
according to the pressure which it sustains, as appears by a bladder
partially filled with air being expanded when the air is drawn from a
receiver in which it is put, by means of the air-pump, and compressed in
the condensing engine, an instrument the reverse of the air-pump.</p>

<p>Air is necessary to the conveyance of sound, to the existence of flame,
and to animal life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_III" id="LECTURE_III"></a>LECTURE III.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Atmospherical Air.</i></h3>

<p>The first species of air that offers itself to our consideration is that
of the atmosphere, which appears to consist of a mixture of two kinds of
air, of different and opposite qualities, <span class="correction"
title="Transcriber's Note: Inserted period.">viz</span>, dephlogisticated and
phlogisticated, in the proportion of about one third of the former to
two thirds of the latter. It is by means of the former of these two
ingredients that it is capable of supporting flame and animal life.</p>

<p>This composition of atmospherical air is proved by several substances
absorbing the dephlogisticated air, and leaving the phlogisticated. All
these processes have been termed <i>phlogistic</i>, because the effect is not
produced but by substances supposed to contain phlogiston in a volatile
state; and by the affinity between phlogiston and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
dephlogisticated part of the air, the one is separated from the other.
Of these processes are the calcination of metals, a mixture of
iron-filings and sulphur, liver of sulphur, the burning of phosphorus,
and the effluvia of flowers.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it is not so clear that any thing is emitted
from the substance that produces this effect; for water deprived of all
air will absorb the dephlogisticated part of the atmospherical in
preference to the phlogisticated part.</p>

<p>As the purity of atmospherical air, or its fitness for respiration,
depends upon the proportion of the dephlogisticated air that it
contains, any of the above-mentioned processes will suffice to determine
it. The more any given quantity of air is diminished by any of them, the
purer it was before the diminution. But this effect is produced the most
quickly by a mixture of nitrous air, or firing inflammable air in it,
being almost instantaneous.</p>

<p>In order to measure the purity of air, it is convenient to take more of
the nitrous or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
inflammable air than is necessary to saturate the dephlogisticated air
it contains. Equal quantities of each best answer the purpose. Supposing
a given quantity of atmospherical air to be mixed with an equal quantity
of nitrous air, and the residuum to be 1.1 measure, the proportion of
dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air in it may be found by the
following arithmetical operation, it being here taken for granted that
one measure of pure dephlogisticated air will saturate two measures of
pure nitrous air.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2.0 viz. one of each.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1.1 the residuum.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">0.3 the dephlogisticated air contained</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">in the measure of the air examined.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And this substracted from <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's
Note: Originally '1.'">1</span> leaves .7 for the proportion of phlogisticated
air in it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_IV" id="LECTURE_IV"></a>LECTURE IV.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Dephlogisticated Air.</i></h3>

<p>Dephlogisticated air, which is one of the component parts of
atmospherical air, is a principal element in the composition of acids,
and may be extracted by means of heat from many substances which contain
them, especially the nitrous and vitriolic; as from nitre, red
precipitate, the vitriols, and turbith mineral, and also from these two
acids themselves, exposed to a red heat in an earthen tube. This kind of
air is also contained in several substances which had attracted it from
the atmosphere, as from precipitate <i>per se</i>, <i>minium</i>, &amp;
<i>manganese</i>.</p>

<p>Dephlogisticated air is likewise produced by the action of light upon
green vegetables; and this seems to be the chief means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
employed by nature to preserve the purity of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is this ingredient in atmospheric air that enables it to support
combustion and animal life. By means of it the most intense heat may be
produced, and in the purest of it animals will live nearly five times as
long as in an equal quantity of atmospherical air.</p>

<p>In respiration, part of this air, passing the membrane of the lungs,
unites with the blood, and imparts to it its florid colour, while the
remainder, uniting with phlogiston exhaled from the venous blood, forms
fixed air. It is dephlogisticated air combined with water that enables
fishes to live in it.</p>

<p>Dephlogisticated air is something heavier than atmospherical air, and
the purity of it measured by mixing with it two equal quantities of
nitrous or inflammable air, deducing the residuum after the diminution
from the three measures employed, and dividing the remainder by 3, as in
the process for common air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of Phlogisticated Air.</i></h3>

<p>The other ingredient in the composition of atmospherical air is
phlogisticated air. It is procured by extracting the dephlogisticated
part of the common air, as by the calcination of metals, &amp;c. &amp;c.
by dissolving animal substances in nitrous acid, and also by the union
of phlogiston with nitrous air, as by heating iron in it, and by a
mixture of iron-filings and sulphur.</p>

<p>Phlogisticated air extinguishes a candle, is entirely unfit for
respiration, and is something lighter than common air. It is not capable
of decomposition, except by exploding it together with a superabundance
of dephlogisticated air, and a quantity of inflammable air, or by taking
the electric spark repeatedly in a mixture of it and dephlogisticated
air. In these cases nitrous acid is formed.</p>

<h3><i>Of Inflammable Air.</i></h3>

<p>Inflammable air is procured from all combustible substances by means of
heat and water, and from several of the metals, especially iron, zink,
and tin, by the vitriolic and marine acids.</p>

<p>From oils and spirit of wine it is procured by the electric spark. By
the same means also alkaline air is converted into it.</p>

<p>That which is procured from metals, especially by steam, is the purest
and the lightest, about ten times lighter than common air; in
consequence of which, if a sufficient quantity be confined in a light
covering, it is possible to make it carry up heavy weights.</p>

<p>When it is procured from animal or vegetable substances, it is of a
heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
kind, and burns with a lambent flame, of various colours, according to
the circumstances.</p>

<p>Calces of metals heated in inflammable air are revived, and the air
absorbed; and since all the metals are revived in the same inflammable
air, the principle of metallization, or <i>phlogiston</i>, appears to be the
same in them all.</p>

<p>Pure inflammable air seems to consist of phlogiston and water, and the
lambent kinds to be the same thing, with the addition of some oily
vapour diffused through it.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_VI" id="LECTURE_VI"></a>LECTURE VI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Nitrous Air.</i></h3>

<p>Nitrous air is procured by dissolving most of the metals, especially
iron, mercury, and copper, in the nitrous acid; but that from mercury
seems to be the purest. Nitrous air produced from copper contains a
mixture of phlogisticated air. Some nitrous air is also obtained from
the solution of all vegetable substances in nitrous acid; whereas animal
substances in the same process yield chiefly phlogisticated air: but in
both these cases there is a mixture of fixed air.</p>

<p>This species of air is likewise produced by impregnating water with
nitrous vapour. This process continues to have this effect after the
water becomes blue, but ceases when it turns green; there not then,
probably, being a sufficient proportion of water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Nitrous air is likewise produced by volatile alkali passing over red hot
manganese, or green vitriol, when they are yielding dephlogisticated
air. This shews that dephlogisticated air is one ingredient in the
composition of nitrous air, and the same thing appears by pyrophorus
burning in it. On the contrary, when nitrous air is made to pass over
red-hot iron, volatile alkali is produced.</p>

<p>Nitrous air is completely decomposed by a mixture of about half its bulk
of dephlogisticated air, and the produce is nitrous acid. And as nitrous
acid is likewise formed by the union of inflammable and dephlogisticated
air, one principal ingredient in nitrous air must be common to it and
inflammable air, or phlogiston. This air is likewise decomposed by
dephlogisticated nitrous acid, which by this means becomes
phlogisticated. It is also decomposed by a solution of green vitriol,
which by this means becomes black, and when exposed to the air, or
heated, emits nitrous air, and recovers its former colour. These
decompositions of nitrous air seem to be effected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
depriving it of phlogiston, and thereby reducing it to the
phlogisticated air originally contained in it.</p>

<p>This kind of air is diminished to about one fourth of its bulk by a
mixture of iron filings and brimstone, or by heating iron in it, or
calcining other metals in it, when the remainder is phlogisticated air.
All that iron gets in this process is an addition of weight, which
appears to be water, but it loses its phlogiston, so that nitrous air
seems to contain more phlogiston, and less water than phlogisticated
air.</p>

<p>Nitrous air and dephlogisticated air will act upon one another through a
bladder, but in this case there remains about one-fourth of the bulk of
nitrous air, and that is phlogisticated air; so that in this case there
seems to be a conversion of nitrous air into phlogisticated air without
any addition of phlogiston.</p>

<p>Nitrous air is decomposed by pyrophorus, and by agitation in olive oil,
which becomes coagulated by the process. It is also absorbed by spirit
of turpentine, by ether, by spirit of wine, and alkaline liquors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
It is imbibed by charcoal, and both that air which is afterwards
expelled from it by heat, and that which remains unabsorbed, is
phlogisticated air.</p>

<p>Nitrous air resists putrefaction, but is diminished by the animal
substances exposed to it to about a fourth of its bulk, and becomes
phlogisticated air. It is likewise fatal to plants, and particularly to
insects.</p>

<p>When nitrous air is long exposed to iron, it is diminished and brought
into a state in which a candle will burn in it, though no animal can
breathe it. But this peculiar modification of nitrous air, called
<i>dephlogisticated nitrous air</i>, is produced with the greatest certainty
by dissolving iron in spirit of nitre saturated with copper,
impregnating water with this air, and then expelling it from the water
by heat. If bits of earthen ware be heated in this dephlogisticated
nitrous air, a great proportion of it becomes permanent air, not
miscible with water, and nearly as pure as common air, so that the
principle of <i>heat</i> seems to be wanting to constitute it permanent air.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_VII" id="LECTURE_VII"></a>LECTURE VII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Fixed Air.</i></h3>

<p>Having considered the properties of those kinds of air which are not
readily absorbed by water, and therefore may be confined by it, I
proceed to those which <i>are</i> absorbed by it, and which require to be
confined by mercury. There are two kinds, however, in a middle state
between these, being absorbed by water, but not very readily; a
considerable time, or agitation, being necessary for that purpose. The
first of these is <i>fixed air</i>.</p>

<p>This kind of air is obtained in the purest state by dissolving marble,
lime-stone, and other kinds of mild calcareous earth in any acid. It is
also obtained by the burning, or the putrefaction, of both animal and
vegetable substances, but with a mixture of both phlogisticated and
inflammable air. Fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
air is also produced by heating together iron filings and red
precipitate; the former of which would alone yield inflammable air, and
the latter dephlogisticated. Fixed air is therefore a combination of
these two kinds of air.</p>

<p>Another fact which proves the same thing is, that if charcoal of copper
be heated in dephlogisticated air, almost the whole of it will be
converted into fixed air. On the same principle fixed air is produced
when iron, and other inflammable substances, are burned in
dephlogisticated air, and also when minium, and other substances
containing dephlogisticated air, are heated in inflammable air.</p>

<p>That water is an essential part of fixed air is proved by an experiment
upon <i>terra ponderosa aerata</i>, which yields fixed air when it is
dissolved in an acid, but not by mere heat. If steam, however, be
admitted to it in that state, it will yield as much fixed air as when it
is dissolved in an acid.</p>

<p>Water absorbs something more than its own bulk of fixed air, and then
becomes a proper acid. Iron dissolved in this water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
makes it a proper chalybeate; as without iron it is of the same nature
with Pyrmont or Seltzer water, which by this means may be made
artificially.</p>

<p>Ice will not imbibe this air, and therefore freezing expels it from
water.</p>

<p>Fixed air extinguishes flame, and is fatal to animals breathing in it.
Also water impregnated with this air is fatal to fishes, and highly
injurious to plants. But water thus impregnated will prevent, in a great
measure, the putrefaction of animal substances.</p>

<p>Fixed air thrown into the intestines, by way of glyster, has been found
to give relief in some cases of putrid disease.</p>

<h3><i>Of Hepatic Air.</i></h3>

<p>Another species of air absorbed by water, but not instantly, is termed
<i>hepatic air</i>, being produced by the solution of liver of sulphur, or of
sulphurated iron, in vitriolic or marine acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Water imbibes about twice its bulk of this kind of air, and it is then
the same thing with the sulphureous waters of Harrowgate.</p>

<h3><i>Of Phosphoric Air.</i></h3>

<p>Phosphoric air is produced by the solution of phosphorus in caustic
fixed alkali. If this air be confined by mercury, it will take fire on
being admitted to atmospheric, and much more to dephlogisticated air.
After agitation in water it loses this property, and the residuum is
merely inflammable air, with no great diminution of its bulk. This kind
of air, therefore, probably consists of phosphorus dissolved in
inflammable air; though it cannot be made by melting it in inflammable
air.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_VIII" id="LECTURE_VIII"></a>LECTURE VIII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Dephlogisticated Marine Acid Air.</i></h3>

<p>This species of air is produced by heating spirit of salt with
manganese; or more readily, by pouring acid of vitriol on a mixture of
salt and manganese, in the proportion of about 16 of the former to 6 of
the latter. In this case the acid of vitriol decomposes the salt, and
the marine acid, disengaged in the form of air, takes dephlogisticated
air from the manganese; so that this species of air seems to consist of
marine acid vapour, and dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>This species of air has a peculiarly pungent smell, and is absorbed by
water as readily as fixed air.</p>

<p>The water takes about twice its bulk of it; and thereby acquires a
yellowish tinge. Both this air, and the water impregnated with it,
discharges vegetable colours from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
linen or cotton, and is thereby useful in bleaching.</p>

<p>This air when cold coagulates into a yellowish substance. It dissolves
mercury, and with it forms <i>corrosive sublimate</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of Phlogisticated Marine Acid Air.</i></h3>

<p>Besides the preceding kinds of air which are slowly absorbed by water,
there are others which are absorbed by it very rapidly, so that they
cannot be confined but by mercury.</p>

<p>Of this kind is <i>phlogisticated marine acid air</i>, procured by the acid
of vitriol and common salt; the former seizing upon the alkaline basis
of the latter, and thereby expelling the marine acid in the form of air.</p>

<p>It is called <i>phlogisticated</i> to distinguish it from <i>dephlogisticated
marine acid air</i>, which seems to be the same thing, with the addition of
dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Phlogisticated marine acid air is heavier than common air. It
extinguishes a candle with a blue flame. It dissolves many substances
containing phlogiston, as iron, dry flesh, &amp;c. and thereby forms a
little inflammable air. Water absorbs 360 times its bulk of this air,
and is then the strongest spirit of salt. It absorbs one-sixth more than
its bulk of alkaline air, and with it forms the common sal ammoniac. Its
affinity to water enables it to dissolve ice, and to deprive borax,
nitre, and other saline substances, of the water that enters into their
composition.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_IX" id="LECTURE_IX"></a>LECTURE IX.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Vitriolic Acid Air.</i></h3>

<p>Vitriolic acid air is procured by heating in hot acid of vitriol almost
any substance containing phlogiston, especially the metals which are
soluble in that acid, as copper, mercury, &amp;c. This kind of air is
heavier than common air, and extinguishes a candle, but without any
particular colour of its flame. It will not dislodge the nitrous or
marine acids from any substance containing them.</p>

<p>By its affinity to water it deprives borax of it.</p>

<p>One measure of this air saturates two of alkaline air, and with it forms
the vitriolic ammoniac.</p>

<p>Water imbibes between 30 and 40 times its bulk of this air, and retains
it when frozen. Water thus impregnated dissolves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
some metals, and thereby yields inflammable air.</p>

<p>If this water be confined in a glass tube, together with common air, and
be exposed to a long continued heat, it forms real sulphur, the
dephlogisticated part of the common air being imbibed, and forming real
vitriolic acid, which uniting with the phlogiston in the air, forms the
sulphur. Also this air mixed with atmospheric air will, without heat,
imbibe some part of it, and thereby become the common acid of vitriol;
so that water impregnated with vitriolic acid air, commonly called
<i>sulphureous</i>, or <i>phlogisticated acid of vitriol</i>, wants
dephlogisticated air to make it the common acid of of vitriol.</p>

<p>This kind of air is imbibed by oils, which thereby change their colour;
whale oil becoming red, olive oil of an orange colour, and spirit of
turpentine of the colour of amber.</p>

<p>If this air be confined in a glass tube by mercury, and the electric
spark be taken in it, a black tinge will be given to the glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
contiguous to the spark, and this black substance appears to be mercury
super-phlogisticated; since by exposure to air it becomes running
mercury: so that the vapour of mercury must be diffused through every
part of this air, to the distance of at least several feet from the
surface of the mercury.</p>

<h3><i>Of Fluor Acid Air.</i></h3>

<p>Fluor acid air is procured by dissolving the earthy substance called
<i>fluor</i> in vitriolic acid.</p>

<p>This kind of air extinguishes a candle, and, like vitriolic acid air,
one measure of it saturates two of alkaline air. It is peculiar to this
kind of air to dissolve glass when it is hot.</p>

<p>It seems to consist of a peculiar acid vapour united to the stony
substance of the fluor; for water being admitted to it absorbs the acid
vapour, and the stony substance is deposited. By this means it exhibits
an amusing appearance, whether water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
be admitted to a glass jar previously filled with that air, or the
bubbles of air be admitted, as they are formed, to a quantity of water
resting on mercury.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_X" id="LECTURE_X"></a>LECTURE X.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Alkaline Air.</i></h3>

<p>Alkaline air is produced by means of heat from caustic volatile alkali,
and also from a mixture of sal-ammoniac and slaked lime, in the
proportion of about one-fourth of the former to three-fourths of the
latter. In this case the marine acid in the sal-ammoniac unites with the
calcareous earth, and the volatile alkali (probably with the assistance
of the water) takes the form of air.</p>

<p>This species of air is heavier than inflammable air, but lighter than
any of the acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
airs. Like them, however, it dissolves ice, and deprives alum, and some
other saline substances, of the water which they contain. United with
fixed air, it makes the concrete volatile alkali; with marine acid air,
the common sal-ammoniac; and with water, the caustic volatile alkali.</p>

<p>The electric spark, or a red heat, converts alkaline air into three
times its bulk of inflammable air; and the calces of metals are revived
in alkaline, as well as in inflammable air; but there remains about
one-fourth of its bulk of phlogisticated air. These facts shew that
alkaline air consists chiefly of phlogiston.</p>

<h3><i>Miscellaneous Observations relating to Air.</i></h3>

<p>The <i>nitrous</i> acid may be exhibited in the form of air, as well as the
vitriolic, the marine, and the fluor acids. But it cannot be confined
even by mercury, which it instantly dissolves. It may, however, in some
measure, be confined in a dry glass vessel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
from which it will in a great measure expel the common air. This nitrous
acid air is that red vapour, which is produced by the rapid solution of
bismuth, and some other metals in the nitrous acid. But the vegetable
acid cannot be exhibited in the form of air. It is only capable of being
converted into vapour, like water: and in the common temperature of our
atmosphere, returns to a state of fluidity.</p>

<p>Different kinds of air which have no affinity to each other, when once
mixed together will not separate, notwithstanding any difference of
specific gravity. Such is the case of a mixture of inflammable and
dephlogisticated air, and even of inflammable and fixed air. Without
this property also, the phlogisticated air, which constitutes the
greatest part of our atmosphere, being specifically lighter than
dephlogisticated air, of which the other part of it consists, would
separate from it, and ascend into the higher regions of the atmosphere.
Inflammable air, however, will not mix with acid or alkaline air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Different kinds of air are expanded differently by the same degrees of
heat; dephlogisticated air the least, and alkaline air the most.</p>

<p>If any fluid, as water, spirit of wine, or even mercury, be heated in a
porous earthen vessel, surrounded by any kind of air, the vapour of the
fluid will pass through the vessel <i>one</i> way, while the air passes the
<i>other</i>; and when the operation ceases, with respect to the <i>one</i>, it
likewise ceases with respect to the <i>other</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XI" id="LECTURE_XI"></a>LECTURE XI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Liquid Substances;</i><br />
AND FIRST OF<br />
<i>WATER</i>.</h3>

<p>Having considered all the substances that are usually found in the form
of <i>air</i>, I come to those that are generally in a <i>fluid</i> form,
beginning with <i>water</i>, which is the principal, if not the only cause of
fluidity to all the other substances that I shall place in this class.</p>

<p>Pure water is a liquid substance, transparent, without colour, taste, or
smell; and with different degrees of heat and cold may be made to assume
the three forms of a solid, of a fluid, and of air. Below 32° of
Fahrenheit it is ice, and above 212° it is vapour; so that in an
atmosphere below 32° it never could have been known to be any thing else
than a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
kind of stone, and above 212° a peculiar species of air.</p>

<p>In passing from the state of a solid to that of a liquid, water absorbs
a great quantity of the principle, or matter, of <i>heat</i>, which remains
in it in a <i>latent</i> state; and in passing from a state of fluid to that
of vapour, it absorbs much more; and this heat is found when the
processes are reversed. It has been observed, that when water becomes
vapour, it takes the form of small globules, hollow within, so as to be
specifically lighter than air.</p>

<p>The degree of heat at which water is converted into vapour depends upon
the pressure of the atmosphere; so that in vacuo, or on the top of a
high mountain, it boils with little heat; and when compressed, as in
Papin's digester, or in the bottom of a deep pit, it requires much heat.
In the former case the restoring of the pressure will instantly put a
stop to the boiling, and in the latter case the removing of the pressure
will instantly convert the heated water into vapour.</p>

<p>The ease with which water is converted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
into vapour by heat, has given a great power to mechanicians, either by
employing the natural pressure of the atmosphere, when steam is
condensed under a moveable pistern, in an iron cylinder, which was the
principle of the old fire-engine, or by employing the elastic power of
steam to produce the same effect, which is the principle of Mr. Watt's
steam engine.</p>

<p>Water was long thought to be incompressible by any external force, but
Mr. Canton has shewn that even the pressure of the atmosphere will
condense it very sensibly.</p>

<p>We do not know any external force equal to that by which water is
expanded when it is converted into ice, or into vapour. For though the
particles of water approach nearer by cold, yet when it crystallizes,
the particles arrange themselves in a particular manner, with
interstices between them; so that, on the whole, it takes up more room
than before.</p>

<p>Water has an affinity to, and combines with, almost all natural
substances, aerial, fluid, or solid; but most intimately with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
acids, alkalies, calcareous earth, and that calx of iron which is called
<i>finery cinder</i>, from which the strongest heat will not expel it.</p>

<p>It has been supposed by some, that by frequent distillation, and also by
agitation, water may be converted into a kind of earth; but this does
not appear to be the case. It has also of late been thought, that water
is resolvable into dephlogisticated and inflammable air; but the
experiments which have been alleged to prove this do not satisfy me; so
that, for any thing that appeared till very lately, water might be
considered as a simple element. By means of heat, however, it seems to
be resolvable into such air as that of which the atmosphere consists,
viz. dephlogisticated and phlogisticated, only with a greater proportion
of the former.</p>

<p>Water, with respect to specific gravity and temperature, has generally
been made the standard to all other substances; its freezing and boiling
points being the limits by means of which thermometers are graduated.
Other substances have also been compared with water, as a standard,
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
respect to the capacity of receiving heat, and retaining it in a latent
state, as will be shewn when we consider the subject of heat.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XII" id="LECTURE_XII"></a>LECTURE XII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Nitrous Acid.</i></h3>

<p>Under the head of <i>liquids</i> I shall consider <i>acids</i> and <i>alkalis</i>,
though some of them may be exhibited in the form of air, and others in a
solid form. These two chemical principles are formed to unite with one
another, and then they constitute what is called a <i>neutral salt</i>.</p>

<p>Both acids and alkalis are distinguishable by their taste. Another test,
and more accurate, is, that acids change the blue juices of vegetables
red, and alkalis turn the syrup of violets green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Acids are generally distinguished according to the three kingdoms to
which they belong, viz. <i>mineral</i>, <i>vegetable</i>, and <i>animal</i>. The
mineral acids are three, the <i>nitrous</i>, the <i>vitriolic</i>, and the
<i>marine</i>.</p>

<p>The nitrous acid is formed by the union of the purest inflammable air,
or the purest nitrous air, with dephlogisticated air. But it is usually
procured from nitre by means of the vitriolic acid, which, seizing its
base, expels the nitrous acid in a liquid form. On this account this
acid is said to be weaker than the vitriolic.</p>

<p>If the nitrous acid be made to pass through a red-hot earthen tube, it
will be decomposed, and the greatest part of it be converted into
dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>Like all other acids, the nitrous acid has a strong affinity to water;
but it is not capable of so much concentration as the vitriolic. It is
generally of an orange or yellow colour; but heat will expel this colour
in the form of a red vapour, which is the same acid in the form of air,
and loaded with phlogiston; and therefore when it is colourless it is
said to be dephlogisticated. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the colourless vapour exposed to heat, or to light, will become coloured
again; and the liquid acid imbibing this coloured vapour, becomes
coloured as before. This acid tinges the skin of a yellow colour, which
does not disappear till the epidermis be changed.</p>

<p>The nitrous acid unites with phlogiston, alkalis, metallic substances,
and calcareous earth.</p>

<p>By means of its affinity with phlogiston it occasions that rapid
accension called <i>detonation</i>, when any salt containing this acid,
especially nitre, is applied to hot charcoal, or when charcoal is put to
hot nitre. In fact, the charcoal burns so rapidly by means of the
dephlogisticated air supplied by the nitre.</p>

<p>A mixture of sulphur assists the accension of these substances, and
makes gunpowder, in the explosion of which much nitrous or
phlogisticated air is suddenly produced, and expanded by the heat. The
application of this force, both to useful and destructive purposes, is
well known. If, instead of nitre, a salt made with
dephlogisticated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
marine acid be made use of, the explosion is more easily produced, and
is much more violent. Friction will do this as well as heat.</p>

<p>Nitre also enters into the composition of <i>pulvis fulminans</i>, viz. three
parts nitre, two of dry alkali, and one of sulphur. This composition
melts, and yields a blue flame, before it explodes.</p>

<p>By means of the affinity of the nitrous acid to <i>oil</i>, another substance
containing phlogiston, it is capable of producing not only a great heat,
but even a sudden flame, especially when mixed with a little vitriolic
acid.</p>

<p>Nitrous acid dissolves all metallic substances except gold and platina,
and in the solution nitrous air is produced.</p>

<p>The particular kinds of saline substances formed by the union of the
nitrous acid with the several metals and earths may be seen in tables
constructed for the purpose. They are all deliquescent.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Vitriolic Acid.</i></h3>

<p>The vitriolic acid, so called because it was originally procured from
<i>vitriol</i>, is now generally procured from sulphur; the dephlogisticated
part of the air uniting with it in the act of burning.</p>

<p>That dephlogisticated air is essential to this acid is evident from the
decomposition of it; for if the vapour of it be made to pass through a
red-hot earthen tube, a great quantity of dephlogisticated air is
procured.</p>

<p>This acid has a strong affinity to water, with which it unites with much
heat; and it is capable of greater concentration, or of being made
specifically heavier, than any other acid. When pure, it is entirely
free from colour and smell, owing, probably, to its being free from
phlogiston, which is inseparable from the nitrous or marine acids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
The vitriolic acid will dislodge the nitrous, or marine, or any other
acid, from their earthy or metallic bases; from which property it is
called the strongest of all the acids.</p>

<p>By means of the superior affinity of the vitriolic acid to earths, and
especially to <i>terra ponderosa</i>, the smallest quantity of it in water
may be discovered by a solution of this earth in the marine acid. In
this acid the terra ponderosa is held in perfect solution; but with the
vitriolic acid it forms a substance that is insoluble in water, and
therefore it instantly appears in the form of a white cloud.</p>

<p>Perhaps chiefly from the strong affinity which this acid has with water,
<i>pyrophorus</i>, consisting of a mixture of alum and several substances
containing phlogiston, takes fire spontaneously on exposure to the air.
It is commonly made of three parts of alum and one of brown sugar, or of
two parts alum, one of salt of tartar, and one of charcoal. They must be
heated till they have for some time emitted a vapour that burns with a
blue flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
The saline substances produced by the union of this acid with the
several earths and metals, are best exhibited in tables constructed for
the purpose. When united to three of the metals, viz. iron, copper, and
zinc, they are called <i>vitriols</i>, green, blue, and white. And all the
substances which this acid unites with crystallize, and do not
deliquesce.</p>

<p>This acid unites with oil, and the mixture is always black.</p>

<p>When any substance containing phlogiston is heated in the vitriolic
acid, another species of the acid, called <i>sulphureous</i>, is formed, of a
pungent smell. In reality, it is water impregnated with vitriolic acid
air. It makes, however, a distinct species of acid, and is dislodged
from its base by most of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Marine Acid.</i></h3>

<p>The marine acid is procured from common salt by the vitriolic acid,
which unites with its base, the fossil alkali.</p>

<p>This acid is generally of a straw-colour; but this is owing to an
impregnation with some earthy matter, most of which it readily
dissolves, especially the metallic ones. It is less capable of
concentration than the vitriolic or nitrous acids, perhaps from a more
intimate union of phlogiston with it. No heat can extract from it any
dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>Though this is denominated a weaker acid than the nitrous, yet it will
take silver, lead, or mercury, from their union with the nitrous acid.
Upon this principle, a solution of these metals in the nitrous acid will
readily discover whether any water contains the marine acid, the latter
uniting with the metal dissolved in the former, and forming with it, if
it be silver, a <i>luna cornea</i>; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
being a substance insoluble in water, discovers itself by a cloudy
appearance.</p>

<p>The union of the marine acid with earths forms salts that easily
deliquesce, but with the metals such as are capable of crystallization;
and so also is that formed by the union of this acid to terra ponderosa.</p>

<p>Neither this acid nor the nitrous will dissolve gold or platina; but a
mixture of them, called <i>aqua regia</i>, will do it.</p>

<p>The marine acid has a strong affinity to dephlogisticated air, and will
take it from manganese and other substances; and with this union it
becomes a different acid, called <i>dephlogisticated marine acid</i>, being
water impregnated with dephlogisticated marine acid air, described
above.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XIV" id="LECTURE_XIV"></a>LECTURE XIV.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Vegetable Acids, and others of a less perfect nature.</i></h3>

<p>The principal of the vegetable acids are the <i>acetous</i> and the
<i>tartareous</i>. The acetous acid is the produce of a peculiar fermentation
of vegetable substances, succeeding the <i>vinous</i>, in which ardent spirit
it is procured, and succeeded by the <i>putrefactive</i>, in which volatile
alkali is generated.</p>

<p>Thus wine is converted into vinegar. Crude vinegar, however, contains
some ingredient from the vegetable substances from which it was
procured: but distillation separates them, and makes the vinegar
colourless; though some of the acid is lost in the process.</p>

<p>The acetous acid is concentrated by frost, which does not affect the
proper acid, but only the water with which it is united. It may likewise
be concentrated by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
first combined with alkalies, earths, or metals, and then dislodged by a
stronger acid, or by mere heat. Thus the acetous acid, combined with
vegetable alkali, forms a substance that is called the <i>foliated earth
of tartar</i>; and it may be expelled from it by the vitriolic acid. When
combined with copper it makes <i>verdigris</i>; and from this union heat
alone will expel it in a concentrated state. The acetous acid thus
concentrated is called <i>radical vinegar</i>. Still, however, it is weaker
than any of the preceding mineral acids.</p>

<p>Several vegetables, as lemons, sorrel, and unripe fruit, contain acids,
ready formed by nature, mixed with some of the essential oil of the
plants, which gives them their peculiar flavours. All these acids have
peculiar properties; but it is not necessary to note them in this very
general view of the subject. Like vinegar, these acids may be
concentrated by frost, and also by a combination with other substances,
and then expelled by a stronger acid.</p>

<p>The <i>acid of tartar</i> is very similar to that of vinegar. Tartar, from
which it is procured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
is a substance deposited on the inside of wine-casks, though it is also
found ready formed in several vegetables. It consists of the vegetable
alkali and this peculiar acid. When refined from its impurities, it is
called <i>crystals</i>, or <i>cream of tartar</i>. The acid is procured by mixing
the tartar with chalk, or lime, which imbibes the superfluous acid, and
this is expelled by the acid of vitriol. Or it may be procured by
boiling the tartar with five or six times its weight of water, and then
putting the acid of vitriol to it. This unites with the vegetable
alkali, and forms vitriolated tartar; and the pure acid of tartar may be
procured in crystals, by evaporation and filtration, equal in weight to
half the cream of tartar. This acid of tartar is more soluble in water
than the cream of tartar.</p>

<p>This acid, united to the mineral alkali, makes <i>Rochelle salt</i>.</p>

<p>Every kind of wood, when distilled, or burned, yields a peculiar acid;
and it is the vapour of this acid that is so offensive to the eyes in
the smoke of wood.</p>

<p>A peculiar acid is obtained from most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
vegetable substances, especially the farinaceous ones, and from sugar,
by distillation with the nitrous acid. This seizes upon the substance
with which the acid was united, and especially the phlogiston adhering
to it, and then the peculiar <i>acid of sugar</i> crystallizes. Thus with
three parts of sugar, and thirty of nitrous acid, one part of the proper
acid of sugar may be obtained. By the same process an acid may be
procured from camphor.</p>

<p>The <i>bark of oak</i>, and some other vegetable substances, especially
nut-galls, contain a substance which has obtained the name of <i>the
astringent principle</i>; the peculiar property of which is, that it
precipitates solutions of iron in the form of a black powder, and in
this manner <i>ink</i> is made. But by solution in water and evaporation,
crystals, which are a proper <i>acid of galls</i>, may be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Amber</i> is a hard semitransparent substance, chiefly found in Prussia,
either dug out of the earth, or thrown up by the sea. It is chiefly
remarkable for its electrical property; but by distillation in close
vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
there sublimes from it a concreted acid, soluble in 24 times its weight
of cold water. Amber seems to be of vegetable origin, and to consist of
an oil united to this peculiar acid.</p>

<p>The acids I shall mention next are of a mineral origin; but being of a
less perfect nature as acids, I shall only just note them here.</p>

<p><i>Borax</i> is a substance chiefly found in a crystallized state in some
lakes in the East Indies. It consists of the mineral alkali and a
peculiar acid, which may be separated, and exhibited in white flakes, by
putting acid of vitriol to a solution of it in water. This acid has been
called <i>sedative salt</i>, from its supposed uses in medicine. It is an
acid that requires fifty times its weight of water to dissolve it.</p>

<p>Several other mineral substances, as <i>arsenic</i>, <i>molybdena</i>, <i>tungsten</i>,
and <i>wolfram</i>, in consequence of being treated as the preceding
vegetables ones, have been lately found to yield peculiar acids. They
are also produced in a concrete state, and require a considerable
proportion of water to make them liquid; but as the water in which they
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
dissolved turns the juice of litmus red, and as they also unite with
alkalis, they have all the necessary characteristics of acids.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XV" id="LECTURE_XV"></a>LECTURE XV.</h2>

<h3><i>Of the Phosphoric Acid.</i></h3>

<p>The most important acid of <i>animal</i> origin, though it has lately been
found in some mineral substances, is the <i>phosphoric</i>.</p>

<p>Phosphorus itself is a remarkable substance, much resembling sulphur,
but much more inflammable. It has been procured chiefly, till of late,
from urine, but now more generally from <i>bones</i>, by means of the
vitriolic acid, which unites with the calcareous earth of which bones
consist, and sets at liberty the phosphoric acid, or the base of that
acid, with which it was naturally combined. The acid thus procured,
mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
with charcoal, and exposed to a strong heat, makes phosphorus.</p>

<p>This substance burns with a lambent flame in the common temperature of
our atmosphere, but with a strong and vivid flame if it be exposed to
the open air when moderately warm. In burning it unites with the
dephlogisticated air of the atmosphere, and in this manner the purest
phosphoric acid is produced.</p>

<p>This acid is also procured in great purity by means of the nitrous or
vitriolic acids, especially the former, which readily combines with the
phlogiston of the phosphorus, and thus leaves the acid pure. In this
process phlogisticated air is produced.</p>

<p>This acid is perfectly colourless, and when exposed to heat loses all
its water, and becomes a glassy substance, not liable to be dissipated
by fire, and readily uniting with earths.</p>

<p>United to the mineral alkali, it forms a neutral salt, lately introduced
into medicine. United to the mineral and vegetable alkalis naturally
contained in urine, it has obtained the name of <i>microcosmic salt</i>,
frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
used as a flux for mineral substances with a blow-pipe.</p>

<p>Besides the phosphoric, there are other acids of an animal origin; as
that of <i>milk</i>, that of <i>sugar of milk</i>, that of the <i>animal calculus</i>,
and that of <i>fat</i>.</p>

<p>The acid of milk is the sour whey contained in butter-milk, which, by a
tedious chemical process, may be obtained pure from any foreign
substance.</p>

<p>The sugar of milk is procured by evaporating the whey to dryness, then
dissolving it in water, clarifying it with whites of eggs, and
evaporating it to the consistence of honey. In this state white crystals
of the acid of sugar of milk will be obtained.</p>

<p>By distilling these crystals with nitrous acid, other crystals of the
proper <i>acid of sugar of milk</i> will be obtained, similar to those of the
acid of sugar.</p>

<p>If the human calculus be distilled, it yields a volatile alkali, and
something sublimes from it which has a sourish taste, and therefore
called the <i>acid of the calculus</i>. It is probably some modification of
the phosphoric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Animal fat yields an acid by distillation, or by first combining it with
quick-lime, and then separating it by the vitriolic acid. Siliceous
earth is corroded by this acid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XVI" id="LECTURE_XVI"></a>LECTURE XVI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Alkalis.</i></h3>

<p>The class of substances that seems particularly formed by nature to
unite with acids, and thereby form <i>neutral salts</i>, are the <i>alkalis</i>.
They have all a peculiar acrid taste, not easily defined. They change
the blue juices of vegetables green, or purple, and in common with acids
have an affinity with water, so as to be capable of being exhibited in a
liquid form; though when this water is expelled by heat, some of them
will assume a solid form.</p>

<p>Alkalis are of two kinds; the <i>fixed</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
which have no smell, and the <i>volatile</i> which have a pungent one.</p>

<p>The fixed alkalis are of <i>vegetable</i> or <i>mineral</i> origin. When in a
solid form, they both melt with a moderate heat, and uniting with earthy
substances, make <i>glass</i>. With an intense heat they are volatilized.</p>

<p>Vegetable alkali is procured by burning plants, and lixiviating the
ashes; a purer kind by the burning of tartar, hence called <i>salt of
tartar</i>; but the purest of all is got by the deflagration of nitre; the
charcoal uniting with the acid as it assumes the form of
dephlogisticated air, and the alkali being left behind.</p>

<p>Mineral alkali is found in ashes of sea-weed. It is likewise the basis
of sea-salt; from which it is separated by several processes, but
especially by the calx of lead, which has a stronger affinity with the
marine acid with which it is found combined.</p>

<p>Alkalis united with fixed air are said to be <i>mild</i>, and when deprived
of it <i>caustic</i>, from their readiness to unite with, and thereby
<i>corrode</i>, vegetable and animal substances. To render them caustic, they
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
deprived of their fixed air by quick-lime; and in this state they unite
with oils, and make <i>soap</i>.</p>

<p>Alkalis have a stronger affinity with acids than metals have with them;
so that they will precipitate them from their solutions in acid
menstruums.</p>

<p>The vegetable fixed alkali has a strong attraction to water, with which
it will become saturated in the common state of our atmosphere, when it
is said to <i>deliquesce</i>; and having the appearance of <i>oil</i>, the salt of
tartar is thus said to become <i>oil of tartar per deliquium</i>. On the
other hand, the mineral, or fossil alkali, is apt to lose its water in a
dry atmosphere, and then it is said to <i>effloresce</i>. In this state it is
often found on old walls.</p>

<p>Volatile alkali is procured by burning animal substances; in Egypt (from
whence, as contained in <i>sal ammoniac</i>, we till of late imported it)
from camel's dung; but now from bones, by distillation. To the liquor
thus procured they add vitriolic acid, or substances which contain it.
This acid unites with the alkali, and common salt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
being put to it, a double affinity takes place. The vitriolic acid
uniting with the mineral alkali of the salt, makes <i>Glauber salt</i>, and
the marine acid uniting with the volatile alkali, makes <i>sal ammoniac</i>.
Slaked lime added to this, unites with the marine acid of the ammoniac,
and sets loose the volatile alkali in the form of <i>alkaline air</i>, which
combining with water, makes the liquid caustic volatile alkali. If chalk
(containing calcareous earth united with fixed air) be mixed with the
sal ammoniac, heat will make the calcareous earth unite with the marine
acid, while the fixed air of the chalk will unite with the volatile
alkali, and assume a solid form, being the <i>sal volatile</i> of the
apothecaries.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XVII" id="LECTURE_XVII"></a>LECTURE XVII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Liquid Inflammable Substances.</i></h3>

<p>Of liquid inflammable substances the principal is <i>spirit of wine</i>,
sometimes called <i>ardent spirit</i>, and, when highly rectified, <i>alcohol</i>.
It is obtained from vegetable substances by their going through the
vinous fermentation. It is considerably lighter than water, colourless,
and transparent, has a peculiar smell and taste, and the property of
inebriating.</p>

<p>Ardent spirit seems to consist of a peculiar combination of phlogiston
and water; for when the vapour of it is made to pass through a red-hot
earthen tube, it is resolved into water and inflammable air. It is
highly inflammable, and burns without smoke, or leaving any residuum;
and in the act of burning its phlogiston so unites with dephlogisticated
air as to make fixed air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Ardent spirit mixes readily with water in all proportions, and also with
essential oils, and balsams or resins, which are the same thing
inspissated.</p>

<p>By its affinity with essential oils, ardent spirit extracts them froth
aromatic plants; and these liquors have obtained the name of
<i>tinctures</i>.</p>

<p>When the tinctures are distilled, the more volatile parts of the
essential oils, which come over in distillation, have acquired the name
of <i>waters</i>; as <i>Lavender water</i>, <i>Rosemary water</i>, &amp;c. and what
remains in the still is called the <i>extract</i> of the plant. If the
tinctures be diluted with much water, the resinous part of the plant
will be obtained pure, and separated from the extractive part, which
will remain dissolved in the water, while the resin separates from it.</p>

<p>Spirit of wine will not dissolve the gummy parts of vegetables; and by
this means the gummy substances may be separated from their solutions in
water, the spirit uniting with the water only. On the other hand, if
resins be dissolved in spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of wine, the affusion of water will separate them. By means of the
affinity of spirit of wine with water, it will seize upon the water in
which several salts are dissolved, and thus produce an instant
crystallization of them.</p>

<p>Salt of tartar has a greater affinity to water than spirit of wine, and
by extracting water from it, will assist in concentrating it; but the
best method of rendering spirit wine free from water is distillation,
the ardent spirit rising before the water.</p>

<p>Spirit of wine mixed with the vitriolic and other mineral acids, renders
them milder, and thereby more proper for certain medicinal uses. This is
called <i>dulcifying</i> them.</p>

<p>Spirit of wine is a powerful antiseptic, and is therefore of use to
preserve vegetable and animal substances from putrefaction.</p>

<h3><i>Of Æther.</i></h3>

<p>If spirit of wine be distilled with almost any of the acids, the produce
is a liquor which has obtained the name of <i>Æther</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
from its extreme lightness and volatility, being much lighter, and more
volatile, than any other fluid that we are acquainted with. It is highly
inflammable, but the burning of it is accompanied with smoke, and some
soot; and on this account it is a medium between spirit of wine and oil,
the acid having taken from the spirit of wine part of the water that was
essential to it, at the same time that it communicated something of its
acid peculiarly modified; since æthers have different properties
according to the acids by which they are made; as the <i>vitriolic</i>, the
<i>nitrous</i>, the <i>marine</i>, and the <i>acetous</i>. No æther, however, can be
made from the marine acid till it has been in some measure
dephlogisticated; from which it may be inferred, that dephlogisticated
air is necessary to the composition of æther. Vitriolic æther is the
most common, in consequence of the process by which it is made being the
easiest.</p>

<p>Æther does not mix with water in all proportions, like spirit of wine,
but ten parts of water will take up one of æther. It easily mixes with
all oils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
It is something remarkable, that though æther will not dissolve gold, it
will take from aqua regia the gold that has been previously <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Originally 'dissoved'.">dissolved</span>
in it.</p>

<p>By the quick evaporation of æther a considerable degree of cold may be
procured; and on this principle it has sometimes been applied to relieve
the head-ach and-other pains.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XVIII" id="LECTURE_XVIII"></a>LECTURE XVIII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Oil.</i></h3>

<p>Oil is a liquid inflammable substance, of great tenacity, disposed to
pour in a stream rather than in drops. It is little, if at all, soluble
in water. It burns with smoke and soot, and leaves a residuum of a coaly
substance. It consists of acid and water combined with phlogiston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
All oil is the produce of the vegetable or animal kingdom, no proper
mineral substance containing any of it.</p>

<p>By distillation oil is in part decomposed, and by this means the thicker
kinds of oil are rendered thinner and more volatile, the acid, to which
their consistence is chiefly owing, being lost in the process. By
repeated distillation it is supposed that all oils may be brought almost
to the state of æther, and even of ardent spirit.</p>

<p>Acids act powerfully upon oils, but very differently, according to the
nature of each. Alkalies also combine with oils, and the less thin and
volatile they are, the more easily are they soluble in alkalies. The
union of alkali and oil makes <i>soap</i>. All oil dissolves sulphur, and
with it makes what is called a <i>balsam</i>. Oils also dissolve metallic
substances, but most sensibly copper and lead. United with the calx of
lead, it is used in painting.</p>

<p>Oil not readily mixing with water, it will diffuse itself over its
surface, and, notwithstanding its tenacity, it will do this very
rapidly, and to a great extent; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
then it has the extraordinary effect of preventing the action of the
wind upon the water, so as to prevent the forming of waves. If a
quantity of oil and water be put into a glass vessel and swung, the
surface of the water below the oil will be seen to change with respect
to the vessel, but not that of the oil. If spirit of wine be put upon
them, that will be at rest, and both the lower fluids in motion.</p>

<p>Vegetable oil is of two kinds, the <i>soft</i>, or <i>mild</i>, which has little
or no taste or smell, and the <i>essential</i> oil, which is thin, and
retains the smell and taste of the plant from which it was extracted.</p>

<p>Mild or sweet oil is expressed from the grains or kernels of vegetables,
and requires a considerable degree of heat to convert it into vapour, in
which state alone it is capable of being inflamed.</p>

<p><i>Essential oil</i> is volatile in the heat of boiling water, and is
generally obtained by means of distillation from the most odoriferous
sorts of plants; but is sometimes found in their vesicles, as in the
rind of an orange. The strong taste of this kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
oil arises from the disengaged acid which abounds in it; and by this
means it is soluble in spirit of wine, which sweet oil is not; but it
loses much of this property by repeated distillations. By long exposure
to the air it loses its more volatile parts, and thereby approaches to
the nature of a resin. This volatile odoriferous principle has been
called the <i>spiritus rector</i> of the plant.</p>

<p>The essential oils of different plants differ much in their specific
gravity, and also in the manner by which they are affected by cold, some
being heavier and others lighter than water, and some being more
difficultly, and others more easily, congealed. Though the differences
with respect to <i>weight</i> and <i>consistency</i> in these oils is probably
owing to the state of the acid that is combined with them, these two
properties are wholly independent of each other; some essential oils
being very thin and yet heavy, and others thick and yet light. Essential
oils are used in perfumes, and also in medicine, acting powerfully the
nervous system.</p>

<p>Essential oils are very apt to be adulterated. If it be with sweet oil,
it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
discovered by evaporation on white paper, or by a solution in spirit of
wine, which will not act upon the sweet oil. If spirit of wine be mixed
with it, it will be discovered by a milky appearance upon putting water
to it, which uniting with the spirit, will leave the oil much divided.
If oil of turpentine, which is the cheapest of essential oils, be mixed
with any of the more valuable kinds, it will be discovered by
evaporation; a strong smell of turpentine being left on the paper, or
cloth, upon which the evaporation was made.</p>

<p>Animal oil, like the vegetable, is of two kinds; the first <i>butter</i>, or
<i>fat</i>, which is easily congealed, owing to the quantity of acid that is
intimately combined with it. It resembles the sweet oil of vegetables in
having no smell or taste. The other kind of animal oil is extracted by
distillation from the flesh, the tendons, the bones, and horns, &amp;c.
of animals. It differs essentially from the other kind of animal oil, by
containing an alkali instead of an acid. By repeated distillation it
becomes highly attenuated and volatile; and in this state it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
called the <i>oil of Dippel</i>, the discoverer of it.</p>

<p>All oil exposed to much heat is in part decomposed, and acquires a
disagreeable smell; and in this state it is said to be <i>empyreumatic</i>:
but this property is lost by repeated distillations.</p>

<p>Besides the vegetable and animal oils above described, there is a fossil
oil called <i>bitumen</i>, the several kinds of which differ much in colour
and consistence; the most liquid is called <i>petroleum</i>, from being found
in the cavities of rocks, and the more solid kinds are <i>amber</i>, <i>jet</i>,
<i>asphaltum</i>, and <i>pit-coal</i>. When distilled, the principal component
parts of all these substances are an oil and an acid. But all fossil oil
is probably of vegetable or animal origin, from masses of vegetables or
animals long buried in the earth. Their differences from resins and
other oily matters are probably owing to <i>time</i>; the combinations of
mineral acids and oils so nearly resembling bitumens, the principal
difference being their insolubility in spirit of wine.</p>

<p>That the most solid of these, as amber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
has been formerly in a liquid state, is evident, from insects and other
substances being frequently found in them; and pit-coal has been often
found with both the internal texture and external appearance of wood; so
that strata of pit-coal have probably been beds of peat in some former
state of the earth.</p>

<h3><i>Of Solid Substances.</i></h3>

<p>All solid substances are capable of becoming fluid by heat, and most of
them may thereby be reduced into a state of vapour, or air; and in
passing from a fluid into a solid state their component parts assume a
particular mode of arrangement, called <i>crystallization</i>, which differs
according to the nature of the substance; so that all solids, especially
if they be suffered to concrete slowly, may be called <i>crystals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Exclusive of <i>salts</i>, which have been considered already, as formed by
the union of acids and alkalis, solids in general have obtained the
names of <i>earths</i>, or <i>stones</i>, which differ only in their texture; and
they are distinguished into those that are <i>metallizable</i>, or those that
are not; the former being called <i>ores</i>, and the latter simply <i>earths</i>;
the principal of which are the <i>calcareous</i>, <i>siliceous</i>,
<i>argillaceous</i>, <i>magnesia</i>, <i>terra ponderosa</i>, and a few others which
have been discovered lately, but have not been much examined.</p>

<h3><i>Of Calcareous Earth.</i></h3>

<p>Calcareous earth is found in the shells of fishes, the bones of animals,
chalk, lime-stone, marble, and gypsum: but all calcareous earth is
supposed to be of animal origin; and beds of chalk, lime-stone, or
marble, are thought to have been beds of shells formed in the sea, in
some pristine state of the earth.</p>

<p>The calcareous earth which is found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> shells, lime-stone, and
marble, is combined with fixed air, discovered by effervescing with
acids. To obtain it perfectly pure, the earth must be pounded and washed
with water, in order to free it from any saline substance which may be
contained in it, then dissolved in distilled vinegar, and precipitated
by mild alkalies. Lime-stone exposed to heat loses about half its
weight, in fixed air and water, and the remainder, called <i>quick-lime</i>,
attracts water very powerfully, and their union is attended with much
heat, after which it dissolves into a fine powder called <i>slaked lime</i>.
If it be left exposed to the atmosphere, it will of itself, by gradually
imbibing moisture, fall into the state of powder.</p>

<p>Water dissolves about one seven <span class="correction" title=
"Transcriber's Note: Originally `hundreth'.">hundreth</span> part of its weight
of quick-lime, and is then called <i>lime-water</i>. Exposed to the air, a
crust will be formed on its surface, which is found to consist of
calcareous earth and fixed air.</p>

<p>Lime and water mixed with sand make <i>mortar</i>, by which means different
stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
may be made to cohere as one mass, which is the most valuable use of
this kind of earth.</p>

<p>Calcareous earth, united with vitriolic acid, makes <i>gypsum</i>; and this
substance pounded and exposed to heat, parts with its water, and is then
called <i>plaister of Paris</i>. In this state, by imbibing water again, it
becomes a firm substance, and thus is useful in making moulds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The earth of animal bones is calcareous united to the phosphoric acid.</p>

<h3><i>Of Siliceous Earth.</i></h3>

<p>Siliceous earth seems to be formed by nature from chalk, perhaps by the
introduction of some unknown acid, which the vitriolic acid is not able
to dislodge. It abounds in most substances which are hard enough to
strike fire with steel, as <i>flint</i>, <i>rock crystal</i>, and most <i>precious
stones</i>. It is not acted upon by any acid except the fluor and
phosphoric, but especially the former: but it is soluble in alkalies;
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
being then dissolved in water, makes <i>liquor silicum</i>, from which the
purest siliceous earth may be precipitated by acids. For this purpose
about four times the weight of alkali must be made use of. With about
equal weights of alkali and siliceous sand is made <i>glass</i>, of so great
use in admitting light and excluding the weather from our houses, as
well as for making various useful utensils. To make glass perfectly
colourless, and at the same time more dense, commonly called <i>flint
glass</i>, manufacturers use a certain proportion of calx of lead and
manganese.</p>

<p>Siliceous earth is not affected by the strongest heat, except by means
of a burning lens, or dephlogisticated air.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XX" id="LECTURE_XX"></a>LECTURE XX.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Argillaceous Earth.</i></h3>

<p>Argillaceous earth is found in <i>clay</i>, <i>schistus</i>, or <i>slate</i>, and in
<i>mica</i>; but the purest is that which is precipitated from a solution of
alum by alkalies; for alum consists of the union of vitriolic acid and
argillaceous earth.</p>

<p>This species of earth is ductile with water; it then hardens and
contracts by heat, so as to be of the greatest use in forming <i>bricks</i>,
or stones of any required form or size. By means of the property of clay
to contract in the fire, Mr. Wedgwood has constructed an excellent
thermometer to measure the degrees of extreme heat.</p>

<p>The ductility of clay seems to depend upon some acid, probably the
vitriolic, adhering to it; for it loses that property when it is burned
into a brick, but recovers it when it has been again dissolved in an
acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of Terra Ponderosa.</i></h3>

<p><i>Terra ponderosa</i>, or <i>marmor metallicum</i>, is generally found in two
states, viz. united to vitriolic acid, when it is called <i>calk</i>, or to
fixed air, when it is called <i>terra ponderosa aerata</i>.</p>

<p>To obtain it pure from its union with the vitriolic acid, it must be
melted with about twice its weight of fixed alkali; which unites with
the acid, and forming a saline substance, may be washed out of it. In
this state it contains water, and therefore, when exposed to heat, will
yield fixed air; whereas the terra ponderosa aerata will not yield fixed
air by heat only, but when steam is made to pass over it when red hot.
This proves that water is essential to the composition of fixed air.</p>

<p>This stone is distinguishable by its great specific gravity, being four
times as heavy as water; but though in this it resembles an <i>ore</i>, it
has not been found to be metallizable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of Magnesia.</i></h3>

<p>This species of earth is found in <i>steatites</i>, or <i>soap rock</i>, <i>Spanish
chalk</i>, <i>asbestus</i>, and <i>Muscovy talck</i>; but the purest is got by
dissolving <i>Epsom salts</i> (which consists of this earth united to the
vitriolic acid) and precipitating it by a mild alkali. In this state it
becomes united to fixed air, which may be expelled by heat. It is then
<i>calcined</i>, or <i>caustic</i>, but differs from quick-lime by not being
soluble in water.</p>

<p><i>Asbestus</i>, which contains much of this kind of earth, is remarkable for
not being destructible by heat, though it is sometimes found in flexible
fibres, so as to be capable of being woven into cloth.</p>

<p><i>Muscovy talck</i> is remarkable for the thin and transparent flakes into
which it is divisible, and thereby capable of various uses.</p>

<p>There are some other distinct species of earth, particularly one brought
from Botany Bay, and another called <i>Stontiate</i>, from the place where it
was found in Scotland; but they have not as yet been much examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
All stones formed by nature are compounded, and to distinguish them from
one another, and ascertain the parts of which they consist, is the
subject of <i>lithology</i>, a very extensive branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>All the simple earths are nearly, if not absolutely, <i>infusible</i>; but
when they are mixed they may all be fused.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXI" id="LECTURE_XXI"></a>LECTURE XXI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Ores</i>.</h3>

<p>Metallizable earths, commonly called <i>ores</i>, when united to phlogiston,
make the metals, distinguishable for their specific gravity, their
opacity, shining appearance, and fusibility.</p>

<p>All the proper metals are <i>malleable</i>, and those which are not so are
called <i>semi-metals</i>.</p>

<p>The metals again are subdivided into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
<i>perfect</i> and <i>imperfect</i>. The former, which are <i>gold</i>, <i>silver</i>, and
<i>platina</i>, suffer no change by fusion, or the longest continued heat:
whereas heat calcines or dissipates the phlogiston of the imperfect
metals, which are <i>mercury</i>, <i>lead</i>, <i>copper</i>, <i>iron</i>, and <i>tin</i>, so
that they return to the state of earth; and this earth is always heavier
than the metal, though of less specific gravity, having received an
addition of weight from water or air: but these earths, or ores, being
exposed to heat in contact with substances containing phlogiston, again
become metals, and are then said to be <i>revived</i>.</p>

<p>The semi-metals are <i>bismuth</i>, <i>zinc</i>, <i>nickel</i>, regulus of <i>arsenic</i>,
of <i>cobalt</i>, of <i>antimony</i>, of <i>manganese</i>, of <i>wolfram</i>, and of
<i>molybdena</i>.</p>

<p>All metallic substances are crystallizable, and each in a peculiar form,
which is discovered by leaving a hole in the bottom of the crucible in
which they are melted, and drawing out the stopper, when the mass is
beginning to lose its fluidity.</p>

<p>Some of the metals will not unite to others when hot, and others of them
will;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
and such as will unite with others are called <i>solders</i>. Thus tin is a
solder for lead, and brass, gold, or silver, for iron.</p>

<p>Ores are never found in regular strata, like the different kinds of
earth; but in places which have formerly been cavities, running in all
directions, with respect to the regular strata, and commonly called
<i>veins</i>.</p>

<p>Many of the ores in their natural state are said to be <i>mineralized</i>
with arsenic or sulphur, those substances being intimately united with
the metallic earths.</p>

<p>In order to convert the ores into metals, some of them are first reduced
to powder, to wash out the earthy or saline particles. They are then
kept in a red heat, which the workmen call <i>roasting</i>, in order to drive
away the arsenic, or sulphur, which are volatile; and in the last place
they are fused in contact with charcoal, or other substances containing
phlogiston; and to promote the fusion, lime-stone is frequently mixed
with them. When the operation is completed, the unmetallic parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
are converted into glass, or <i>scoria</i>, which lies on the surface,
whereas the metal is found at the bottom.</p>

<p>To discover the quantity of metal in a small piece of ore is called
<i>assaying</i>.</p>

<p>When metals are fused together, the specific gravity, fusibility, and
other properties are changed, and in such a manner as could not be
discovered from the properties of the constituent parts.</p>

<h3><i>Of Gold.</i></h3>

<p>Gold is the heaviest of all metallic bodies except platina. It appears
yellow or reddish by reflected light, but green or blue by transmitted
light, when it is reduced to thin plates.</p>

<p>Though gold undergoes no change in a common furnace, or burning lens, it
may, in part, at least, be calcined by the electric shock.</p>

<p>Gold has the greatest <i>ductility</i>, and in wires of equal diameters, it
has the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<i>tenacity</i>, of all the metals. One grain of it may be made to cover 56
square inches; some gold leaf being less than a 200,000th part of an
inch thick; and when it is made to cover a silver wire, the gold upon it
may not be more than one twelfth part of the thickness of the gold leaf.</p>

<p>This metal is soluble in aqua regia; and being precipitated by a
volatile alkali, makes a powder called <i>aurum fulminans</i>, which is one
fourth heavier than the gold, and explodes with great violence in a heat
something greater than that of boiling water.</p>

<p>Tin precipitates gold in the form of a purple powder, called the <i>powder
of Cassius</i>, from the inventor of it, and is used in enamels, or the
glassy coating which is given to metals by heat.</p>

<p>Gold unites with most of the metals, especially with mercury, and these
mixtures are called <i>amalgams</i>. In gilding, the amalgam is applied to
the surface of the metal to be gilded, and the mercury is driven off by
heat, leaving the gold attached to the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Gold mixed with iron, makes it harder, for the purpose of cutting
instruments.</p>

<p>To separate gold from the imperfect metals, such as copper, &amp;c. it
is mixed with lead, and then exposed to a strong heat, which calcines
the lead, and with it the imperfect metals, leaving the gold pure. This
process is called <i>cupellation</i>, from being performed in a small
crucible called a <i>cupell</i>. When the gold is mixed with silver, three
parts more of silver are put to it, and then the silver is dissolved by
nitrous acid, leaving the gold pure. This process is called
<i>quartation</i>, from the gold being one fourth part of the mass.</p>

<p>The fineness of gold is generally estimated by dividing the gold into
twenty-four parts, called <i>carats</i>. The phrase twenty-three carats fine
means that the mass contains twenty-three parts out of twenty-four of
pure gold, the remainder being <i>alloy</i>, of some baser metal. The
fineness of gold may in some measure be discovered by the colour it
leaves upon a <i>touch-stone</i>, or fine-grained basaltes.</p>

<p>Gold is generally found nearly pure, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
mixed with earth, or diffused in fine grains through stones.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXII" id="LECTURE_XXII"></a>LECTURE XXII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Silver.</i></h3>

<p>Silver is the whitest of all the metals, very ductile, but less so than
gold; the thinnest leaves of it being one third thicker than those of
gold. It is not calcined in the heat of a common furnace, but partially
so by repeated fusion, or a strong burning lens.</p>

<p>Sulphureous fumes unite with silver, and tinge it black. The nitrous
acid dissolves it, and will hold more than half its weight of it in
solution. When fully saturated, this solution deposits crystals, which
are called <i>lunar nitre</i>, or <i>nitre of silver</i>. When these crystals are
melted, and the water they contain driven off, a black substance,
called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<i>lapis infernalis</i>, or <i>lunar caustic</i>, is formed. This is used as a
cautery in surgery. A strong heat will decompose this lunar nitre, and
recover the silver.</p>

<p>Though the nitrous acid dissolves silver the most readily, the marine
acid will deprive the nitrous of it, and form a substance called <i>luna
cornea</i>, because, when it is melted and cold, it becomes a transparent
mass something resembling <i>horn</i>. From this luna cornea the purest
silver may be obtained. The vitriolic acid will likewise deprive the
nitrous of the silver contained in it, and form a white powder, not
easily soluble in water.</p>

<p>A fulminating silver may be made by the following process: the silver
must first be dissolved in pale nitrous acid, then precipitated by
lime-water, dried, and exposed to the air three days. It must then be
washed in caustic volatile alkali, after which the fluid must be
decanted, and the black powder left to dry in the air. The slightest
friction will cause this powder to fulminate. It is said, that even a
drop of water falling upon it will produce this effect; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
that it ought to be made only in very small quantities, and managed with
the greatest caution.</p>

<p>Most of the metals precipitate silver. That by mercury may be made to
assume the form of a tree, called <i>arbor Dianæ</i>.</p>

<p>Silver is found native in Peru; and the ores frequently contain sulphur,
or arsenic, or both.</p>

<h3><i>Of Platina.</i></h3>

<p>Platina is a metal lately discovered in the gold mines of Mexico, where
it is found in small particles, never exceeding the size of a pea, mixed
with ferruginous sand and quartz.</p>

<p>The strongest fire will not melt these grains, though it will make them
cohere; but they may be melted by a burning lens, or a blow-pipe
supplied with dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>Pure platina is the heaviest body in nature, its specific gravity
exceeding twenty-two. It is very malleable, though considerably harder
than gold or silver, and has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the property of welding in common with iron. This metal is not affected
by exposure to the air, or by any simple acid, though concentrated and
hot; but it is dissolved by dephlogisticated marine acid, and by aqua
regia, in which a little nitrous air is procured. The solution is brown,
and when diluted yellow. This liquor is very corrosive, and tinges
animal substances of a blackish brown colour. Platina is precipitated
from a solution in aqua regia by sal-ammoniac, as gold is by martial
vitriol. Iron is precipitated from this solution by the Prussian alkali.
Also most of the metals precipitate platina, but not in its metallic
state.</p>

<p>Arsenic facilitates the solution of platina; and by melting it with
equal parts of arsenic and vegetable alkali, and then reducing the mass
to a powder, it may be made to take any form; and a strong heat will
dissipate the arsenic and the alkali, leaving the platina in the shape
required, not fusible by any heat in a common furnace.</p>

<p>Platina does not readily combine with gold or silver, and it resists the
action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
mercury as much as iron; but it mixes well with lead, making it less
ductile, and even brittle, according to the proportion of the platina.
With copper it forms a compound which takes a beautiful polish, not
liable to tarnish, and is therefore used with advantage for mirrors of
reflecting telescopes. It unites easily with tin, and also with bismuth,
antimony, and zinc.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXIII" id="LECTURE_XXIII"></a>LECTURE XXIII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Mercury.</i></h3>

<p>Mercury is the most fusible of all the metals, not becoming solid but in
40° below 0 in Fahrenheit's thermometer. It is then malleable. It is
heavier than any other metal except gold or platina. It is volatile in a
temperature much lower than that of boiling water, and in vacuo in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
common temperature of the atmosphere; and at six hundred it boils.</p>

<p>In a degree of heat in which it would rise easily in vapour, mercury
imbibes pure air, and becomes a red calx, called <i>precipitate per se</i>.
At a greater degree of heat it parts with that air, and is running
mercury again.</p>

<p>Mercury is not perceptibly altered by exposure to the air.</p>

<p>Mercury is acted upon by the vitriolic acid when hot. In this process
vitriolic acid air is procured, and the mercury is converted into a
white substance, which being dipped in water becomes yellow, called
<i>turbith mineral</i>, one third heavier than the mercury from which it was
made. By heat this substance parts with its pure air, and becomes
running mercury; but if the process be made in a clean earthen vessel,
there will remain a portion of <i>red calx</i>, which cannot be reduced by
any degree of heat, except in contact with some substance containing
phlogiston. If this be done with a burning lens, in inflammable air,
much of the air will be absorbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Mercury is dissolved most readily in the nitrous acid, when the purest
nitrous air is procured; and there remains a substance which is first
yellow, and by continuance red, called <i>red precipitate</i>. In a greater
degree of heat the dephlogisticated air will be recovered, and the
mercury be revived; but the substance yields nitrous air after it
becomes solid, and till it changes from yellow to red.</p>

<p>The precipitates of mercury from acids by means of alkalies possess the
property of exploding, when they are exposed to a gradual heat in an
iron spoon, after having been triturated with one sixth of their weight
of the flowers of sulphur. The residuum consists of a violet-coloured
powder, which, by sublimation, is converted into cinnabar.</p>

<p>It seems, therefore, as if the sulphur combined suddenly with the
mercury, and expelled the dephlogisticated air in an elastic state.</p>

<p>The marine acid seizes upon mercury dissolved in nitrous acid, and if
the acid be dephlogisticated, the precipitate is <i>corrosive
sublimate</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
but with common marine acid, it is called <i>calomel</i>, or <i>mercurius
dulcis</i>. This preparation is generally made in the dry way, by
triturating equal parts of mercury, common salt and vitriol, and
exposing the whole to a moderate heat; when the corrosive sublimate
rises, and adheres to the upper part of the glass vessel in which the
process is made.</p>

<p>Mercury combines readily with sulphur by trituration, and with it forms
a black powder called <i>Ethiops mineral</i>. A more intimate combination of
mercury and sulphur is made by means of fire. This is called <i>cinnabar</i>,
about one third of which is sulphur. Vermillion is cinnabar reduced to
powder.</p>

<p>Mercury readily unites with oil, and with it forms a deep black or blue
compound, used in medicine.</p>

<p>It readily combines with most of the metals, and when it is used in a
sufficient quantity to make them soft, the mixture is called an
<i>amalgam</i>. It combines most readily with gold, silver, lead, tin,
bismuth, and zinc. Looking-glasses are covered on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the back with an amalgam of mercury and tin.</p>

<p>When mercury is united with lead or other metals, it is rendered less
brilliant and less fluid; but agitation in pure air converts the impure
metal into a calx, together with much of the mercury, in the form of a
black powder.</p>

<p>Heat recovers the pure air, and the mercury, leaving the calx of the
impure metal.</p>

<p>Much mercury is found native in a slaty kind of earth, or in masses of
clay or stone; but the greatest quantity is found combined with sulphur
in <i>native cinnabar</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXIV" id="LECTURE_XXIV"></a>LECTURE XXIV.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Lead.</i></h3>

<p>Lead is a metal of a bluish tinge, of no great tenacity, but very
considerable specific gravity, being heavier than silver. It melts long
before it is red hot, and is then calcined, if it be in contact with
respirable air. When boiling it emits fumes, and calcines very rapidly.
It may be granulated by being poured into a wooden box, and agitated.
During congelation it is brittle, so that the parts will separate by the
stroke of a hammer; and by this means the form of its crystals may be
discovered.</p>

<p>In the progress of calcination it first becomes a dusky grey powder,
then yellow, when it is called <i>massicot</i>; then, by imbibing pure air,
it becomes red, and is called <i>minium</i>, or <i>red lead</i>. In a greater
degree of heat it becomes massicot again, having parted with its pure
air. If the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
be too great, and applied rapidly, it becomes a flaky substance, called
<i>litharge</i>; and with more heat it becomes a <i>glass</i>, which readily
unites with metallic calces and earths, and is a principal ingredient in
the manufacture of <i>flint glass</i>, giving it its peculiar density and
refractive power.</p>

<p>Though lead soon tarnishes, the imperfect calx thus made does not
separate from the rest of the metal, and therefore protects it from any
farther action of the air, by which means it is very useful for the
covering of houses, and other similar purposes. All acids act upon lead,
and form with it different saline substances. <i>White-lead</i> consists of
its union with vinegar and pure air. Also dissolved in vinegar, and
crystallized, it becomes <i>sugar of lead</i>, which, like all the other
preparations of this metal, is a deadly poison.</p>

<p>Oils dissolve the calces of lead, which, by this means, is the basis of
paints, plaisters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>By means of heat litharge decomposes common salt, the lead uniting with
the marine acid, and forming a yellow substance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
used in painting, and by this means the fossil alkali is separated.</p>

<p>Lead unites with most metals, though not with iron. Two parts of lead
and one of tin make a <i>solder</i>, which melts with less heat than either
of the metals separately; but a composition of eight parts of bismuth,
five of lead, and three of tin, makes a metal which melts in boiling
water.</p>

<p>This metal will be dissolved by water if it contain any saline matter,
and the drinking of it occasions a peculiar kind of cholic.</p>

<p>Lead is sometimes found native, but generally minerally mineralized with
sulphur or arsenic, and often mixed with a small quantity of silver.</p>

<h3><i>Of Copper.</i></h3>

<p>Copper is a metal of a reddish or brownish colour, considerably
sonorous, and very malleable.</p>

<p>At a heat far below ignition, the surface, of copper becomes covered
with a range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
prismatic colours, the commencement of its calcination; and with more
heat a black scale is formed, which easily separates from the metal, and
in a strong heat it melts, and burns with a bluish green flame.</p>

<p>Copper rusts by exposure to the air; but the partially-calcined surface
adheres to the metal, as in the case of lead, and thus preserves it from
farther corrosion.</p>

<p>Copper dissolved in the vitriolic acid forms crystals of a blot colour,
called <i>blue copperas</i>. From this solution it is precipitated by iron,
which by this means becomes coated with copper. The nitrous acid
dissolves copper with most rapidity, producing nitrous air. If the
solution be distilled, almost all the acid will be retained in the
residuum, which is white; but more heat will expel the acid, chiefly in
the form of dephlogisticated air, and the remainder will be a black
substance, consisting of the pure calx of copper. The vegetable acids
dissolve copper as well as the mineral ones, which makes the use of this
metal for culinary purposes in some cases dangerous.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
To prevent this they give it a coat of tin. The solution of copper in
the vegetable acid is called <i>verdigris</i>.</p>

<p>Alkalies dissolve copper as well as acids. With the volatile alkali a
blue liquor is formed, but in some cases it becomes colourless. All the
circumstances of this change of colour have not yet been examined. Both
oil and sulphur will dissolve copper, and with the latter it forms a
blackish grey compound, used by dyers.</p>

<p>Copper readily unites with melted tin, at a temperature much lower than
that which is necessary to melt the copper; by which means copper
vessels are easily covered with a coating of tin. A mixture of copper
and tin, called <i>bronze</i>, the specific gravity of which is greater than
that of the medium of the two metals, is used in casting statues,
cannon, and bells; and in a certain proportion this mixture is excellent
for the purpose of mirrors of reflecting telescopes, receiving a fine
polish, and not being apt to tarnish. Copper and arsenic make a brittle
compound called <i>tombach</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and with zinc it makes the useful compound commonly called <i>brass</i>, in
which zinc is about one third of its weight.</p>

<p>Copper is sometimes found native; but commonly mixed with sulphur, in
ores of a red, green, or blue colour.</p>

<p>Copper being an earlier discovery than that of iron, was formerly used
for weapons and the shoeing of horses; and the ancients had a method,
with which we are not well acquainted, of giving it a considerable
degree of hardness, so that a sword made of it might have a pretty good
edge.</p>

<h3><i>Of Iron.</i></h3>

<p>Iron is a metal of a bluish colour, of the greatest hardness, the most
variable in its properties, and the most useful of all the metals; so
that without it it is hardly possible for any people to make great
advances in arts and civilization.</p>

<p>This metal readily parts with its phlogiston, so as to be very subject
to calcine, or rust, by exposure to the air. The same is evident by the
colours which appear on its surface when exposed to heat, and also when
it is struck with flint; the particles that fly from it being iron
partially calcined. In consequence of its readily parting with its
phlogiston, it is capable of burning, like wood or other fuel, in pure
air.</p>

<p>Iron and platina have the property of <i>welding</i> when very hot, so that
two pieces may be joined without any solder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
When iron is heated in contact with steam, part of the water takes the
place of the phlogiston, while the rest unites with it, and makes
inflammable air. By this means the iron acquires one third more weight,
and becomes what is called <i>finery cinder</i>. This substance, heated in
inflammable air, imbibes it, parts with its water, and becomes perfect
iron again. If the iron be heated in pure air, it also imbibes the
water, of which that air chiefly consists, and also a portion of the
peculiar element of the pure air.</p>

<p>The solution of iron in spirit of vitriol produces <i>green copperas</i>;
which being calcined, becomes a red substance, called <i>colcothar</i>.</p>

<p>The precipitate of iron, by an infusion of galls, is the colouring
matter in <i>ink</i>, which is kept suspended by means of gum. The
precipitate from the same solution by phlogisticated alkali, is
<i>Prussian blue</i>.</p>

<p>Water saturated with fixed air dissolves iron, and makes a pleasant
chalybeat.</p>

<p>The calx of iron gives a green colour to glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Iron readily combines with sulphur. When they are found combined by
nature, the substance is called <i>pyrites</i>.</p>

<p>The union of phosphoric acid with iron makes it brittle when cold,
commonly called <i>cold short</i>; and the union of arsenic makes it brittle
when hot, thence called <i>red short</i>.</p>

<p>Iron unites with gold, silver, and platina, and plunged in a white heat
into mercury, it becomes coated with it; and if the process be
frequently repeated, it will become brittle, which shews that there is
some mutual action between them.</p>

<p>Iron readily unites with tin; and by dipping thin plates of iron into
melted tin, they get a complete coating of it, and make the <i>tinned
plates</i> in common use.</p>

<p>When crude iron comes from the smelting furnace it is brittle; and when
it is white within, it is extremely hard; but when it has a black grain,
owing to its having more phlogiston, it is softer, and may be filed and
bored.</p>

<p>Cast iron becomes <i>malleable</i> by being exposed to a blast of air when
nearly melting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the consequence of which is a discharge of inflammable air, and the
separation of a liquid substance, which, when concreted, is called
<i>finery cinder</i>. The iron generally loses one fourth of its weight in
the process. Crude iron contains much <i>plumbago</i>, and the access of pure
air probably assists in discharging it, by converting it into air,
chiefly inflammable.</p>

<p>Malleable iron, exposed to a red heat in contact with charcoal, called
<i>cementation</i>, converts it into <i>steel</i>, which has the properties of
becoming much harder than iron, and very elastic, by being first made
very hot, and then suddenly cooled, by plunging it in cold water. By
first making it very hard, and then giving different degrees of heat,
and cooling it in those different degrees, it is capable of a great
variety of <i>tempers</i>, proper for different uses. Of the degrees of heat
workmen judge by the change of colour on its surface. Steel, like crude
iron, is capable of being melted without losing its properties. It is
then called <i>cast steel</i>, and is of a more uniform texture. Iron
acquires some little weight by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
converted into steel; and when dissolved in acid, it yields more
plumbago. Steel has something less specific gravity than iron. If the
cementation be continued too long, the steel acquires a darkish
fracture, it is more fusible, and incapable of welding. Steel heated in
contact with earthy matters, is reduced to iron.</p>

<p>Iron is the only substance capable of <i>magnetism</i>; and hardened steel
alone is capable of retaining magnetism. The loadstone is an ore of
iron.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXVI" id="LECTURE_XXVI"></a>LECTURE XXVI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Tin.</i></h3>

<p>Tin is a metal of a slightly yellowish cast, though harder than lead,
very malleable, but of no great tenacity; so that wires cannot be made
of it. It easily extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
under the hammer, and plates of it, called <i>tinfoil</i>, are made only one
thousandth part of an inch thick, and might be made as thin again.</p>

<p>Tin has less specific gravity than any other metal. It melts long before
ignition, at 410 of Fahrenheit, and by the continuance of heat is slowly
converted into a white powder, which is the chief ingredient in <i>putty</i>,
used in polishing, &amp;c. Like lead, it is brittle when heated little
short of fusion, and may be reduced into grains by agitation as it
passes from a fluid to a solid state.</p>

<p>The calx of tin resists fusion more than that of any other metal, which
makes it useful in making an opaque white enamel.</p>

<p>Tin loses its bright surface when exposed to the air, but is not
properly subject to rust; so that it is useful in protecting iron and
other metals from the effects of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Concentrated vitriolic acid, assisted by heat, dissolves half its weight
of tin, and yields vitriolic acid air. With more water it yields
inflammable air. During the solution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the phlogiston of the tin uniting with the acid, forms sulphur, which
makes it turbid. By long standing, or the addition of water, the calx of
tin is precipitated from the solution. The nitrous acid dissolves tin
very rapidly without heat, and yields but little nitrous air. With
marine acid this metal yields inflammable air. With aqua regia it
assumes the form of a gelatinous substance used by dyers to heighten the
colour of some red tinctures, so as to produce a bright scarlet in dying
wool.</p>

<p>A transparent liquor, which emits very copious fumes, called, from the
inventor, <i>the smoking liquor of Libavius</i>, is made by distilling equal
parts of amalgam of tin and mercury with corrosive sublimate, triturated
together. A colourless liquor comes over first, and then a thick white
fume, which condenses into the transparent liquor above mentioned. Mr.
Adet has shewn, that this liquor bears the same relation to the common
solution of tin, that corrosive sublimate does to calomel, and has given
an ingenious solution of many of its properties.</p>

<p>Tin detonates with nitre; and if the crystals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
made by the solution of copper in the nitrous acid be inclosed in
tinfoil, nitrous fumes will be emitted, and the whole will become red
hot. Also if five times its weight of sulphur be added to melted tin, a
black brittle compound, which readily takes fire, will be formed.</p>

<p>Another combination of tin, sulphur, and mercury, makes a light yellow
substance called <i>aurum musivum</i> used in painting.</p>

<p>Tin is the principal ingredient in the composition of <i>pewter</i>, the
other ingredients being lead, zinc, bismuth, and copper; each pewterer
having his peculiar receipt. It is also used in coating copper and iron
plates, and in silvering looking-glasses, besides being cast into a
variety of forms, when it is called <i>block tin</i>.</p>

<p>Tin is sometimes found native, but is generally mineralized with sulphur
and arsenic. The latter is thought to be always contained in tin, and to
be the cause of the crackling noise made by bending plates of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Of the Semi-metals.</i></h3>

<p>Bismuth is a semi-metal of a yellowish or reddish cast, but little
subject to change in the air; harder than lead, but easily broken, and
reducible to powder. When broken it exhibits large shining facets, in a
variety of positions. Thin pieces of it are considerably sonorous.</p>

<p>Bismuth melts at about 460° of Fahrenheit. With more heat it <span
class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: Originally
'ignates'.">ignites</span>, and burns with a slight blue flame, while a
yellowish calx, called <i>flowers of bismuth</i>, is produced. With more heat
it becomes a greenish glass. In a strong heat, and in close vessels,
this metal sublimes.</p>

<p>Vitriolic acid, even concentrated and boiling, has but little effect
upon bismuth; but the nitrous acid acts upon it with the greatest
rapidity and violence, producing much nitrous air, mixed with
phlogisticated nitrous vapour. From the solution of bismuth in this
acid, a white substance, called <i>magistery of bismuth</i>, is precipitated
by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
affusion of water. This has been used as a paint for the skin but has
been thought to injure it.</p>

<p>The marine acid does not readily act upon bismuth; but when
concentrated, it forms with it a saline combination, which does not
easily crystallize, but may be sublimed in the form of a soft fusible
salt, called <i>butter of bismuth</i>.</p>

<p>Bismuth unites with most metallic substances, and in general renders
them more fusible. When calcined with the imperfect metals, it unites
with them, and has the same effect as lead in cupellation.</p>

<p>Bismuth is used in the composition of pewter, in printers' types, and
other metallic mixtures.</p>

<p>This metal is sometimes found native, but more commonly mineralized with
sulphur.</p>

<h3><i>Of Nickel.</i></h3>

<p>Nickel is a semi-metal of a reddish cast, of great hardness, and always
magnetical; on which account it is supposed to contain iron, though
chemists have not yet been able to separate them.</p>

<p>The purest nickel was so infusible as not to run into a mass in the
strongest heat of a smith's forge; but then it was in some degree
malleable.</p>

<p>Concentrated acid of vitriol only corrodes nickel. Alkalies precipitate
it from its solution in the nitrous acid, and dissolve the precipitate.
It readily unites with sulphur.</p>

<p>Nickel is found either native or mineralized with several other metals,
especially with copper, when it is called <i>kupfer nickel</i>, or <i>false
copper</i>, being of a reddish or copper colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
This semi-metal has not yet been applied to any use.</p>

<h3><i>Of Arsenic.</i></h3>

<p>What is commonly called <i>arsenic</i> is the calx of a semi-metal called the
<i>regulus of arsenic</i>. It is a white and brittle substance, expelled from
the ores of several metals by heat. It is then refined by a second
sublimation, and melted into the masses in which it is commonly sold.
This calx is soluble in about eighty times its weight of cold water, or
in fifteen times its weight of boiling water. It acts in many respects
like an acid, as it decomposes nitre by distillation, when the nitrous
acid flies off, and the <i>arsenical salt of Macquer</i> remains behind.</p>

<p>When the calx of arsenic is distilled with sulphur, the vitriolic acid
flies off, and a substance of a yellow colour, called <i>orpiment</i>, is
produced. This appears to consist of sulphur and the regulus of arsenic;
part of the sulphur receiving pure air from the calx, to which it
communicates phlogiston; and thus the sulphur becomes converted into
vitriolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
acid, while the arsenical calx is reduced, and combines with the rest of
the sulphur.</p>

<p>The combination of sulphur and arsenic, by melting them together, is of
a red colour, known by the name of <i>realgal</i>, or <i>realgar</i>. It is less
volatile than orpiment.</p>

<p>The solution of fixed alkali dissolves the calx of arsenic, and by means
of heat a brown tenacious mass is produced, and having also a
disagreeable smell, it is called <i>liver of arsenic</i>.</p>

<p>The regulus of arsenic is of a yellow colour, subject to tarnish or grow
black, by exposure to the air, very brittle, and of a laminated texture.
In close vessels it wholly sublimes, but burns with a small flame in
pure air.</p>

<p>Vitriolic acid has little action upon this semi-metal, except when hot;
but the nitrous acid acts readily upon it, and likewise dissolves the
calx, as does boiling marine acid, though it affects it very little when
cold.</p>

<p>Most of the metals unite with the regulus of arsenic.</p>

<p>Dephlogisticated marine acid converts the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
calx of arsenic into <i>arsenical acid</i> by giving it pure air.</p>

<p>The acid of arsenic acts more or less upon all metals, but the phenomena
do not appear to be of much importance.</p>

<p>The calx of acid is used in a variety of the arts, especially in the
manufactory of glass. Orpiment and realgar are used as pigments. Some
attempts have been made to introduce it into medicine, but being
dangerous, the experiments should be made with caution.</p>

<h3><i>Of Cobalt.</i></h3>

<p>Cobalt is a semi-metal of a grey or steel colour, of a close-grained
fracture, more difficult of fusion than copper, not easily calcined. It
soon tarnishes in the air, but water has no effect upon it.</p>

<p>Cobalt, dissolved in <i>aqua regia</i>, makes an excellent sympathetic ink,
appearing green when held to the fire, and disappearing when cold,
unless it has been heated too much, when it burns the paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The calx of cobalt is of a deep blue colour, which, when fused, makes
the blue glass called <i>smalt</i>. The ore of cobalt, called <i>zaffre</i>, is
found in several parts of Europe, but chiefly in Saxony. As it is
commonly sold, it contains twice or thrice its weight of powder of
flints. The smalt is usually composed of one part of calcined cobalt,
fused with two parts of powder of flint and one of pot-ash.</p>

<p>The chief use of cobalt is for making smalt; but the powder and the
blue-stone used by laundresses is a preparation made by the Dutch of a
coarse kind of smalt.</p>

<h3><i>Of Zinc.</i></h3>

<p>Zinc is a semi-metal of a bluish cast, brighter than lead, and so far
malleable as not to be broken by a hammer, though it cannot be much
extended. When broken by bending, it appears to consist of cubical
grains. If it be heated nearly to melting, it will be sufficiently
brittle to be pulverized. It melts long before ignition, and when it is
red hot, it burns with a dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
white flame, and is calcined with such rapidity, that its calx flies up
in the form of white flowers, called <i>flowers of zinc</i>, or
<i>philosophical wool</i>. In a stronger heat they become a clear yellow
glass. Heated in close vessels, this metal rises without decomposition,
being the most volatile of all the metals except the regulus of
<i>arsenic</i>.</p>

<p>Zinc dissolved in diluted vitriolic acid, yields much inflammable air,
and has a residuum, which appears to be plumbago, and the liquor forms
crystals, called <i>white copperas</i>. This metals also yields inflammable
air when dissolved in the marine acid. Dissolved in the nitrous acid, it
yields dephlogisticated nitrous air, with very little proper nitrous
air.</p>

<p>The ore of zinc, called <i>calamine</i>, is generally of a white colour; and
the chief use of it is to unite it with copper, with which it makes
brass and other gold-coloured mixtures of metals. The calx and the salts
of this metal are occasionally used in medicine.</p>

<h3><i>Of Antimony.</i></h3>

<p>The regulus of <span class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note:
Originally 'animony'.">antimony</span> is of a silvery white colour, of a scaly
texture, very brittle, and melts soon after ignition. By continuance of
heat it calcines in white fumes, called <i>argentine flowers of antimony</i>,
which melt into a hyacinthine glass. In close vessels it rises without
decomposition. Its calx is soluble in water, like that of arsenic. This
metal tarnishes, but does not properly rust, by exposure to the air.</p>

<p>This metal is soluble in aqua regia. It detonates with nitre, and what
remains of equal parts of nitre and regulus of antimony after
detonation, in a hot crucible, is called <i>diaphoretic antimony</i>. The
water used in this preparation contains a portion of the calx suspended
by the alkali, and being precipitated by an acid, is called <i>ceruse of
antimony</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
When regulus of antimony is pulverized and mixed with twice its weight
of corrosive sublimate (which is attended with heat) and then distilled
with a gentle fire, a thick fluid comes over, which is congealed in the
receiver, or in the neck of the retort, and is called <i>butter of
antimony</i>. The residuum consists of revived mercury, with some regulus
and calx of antimony. When this butter of antimony is thrown into pure
water, there is a white precipitate, called <i>powder of algaroth</i>, a
violent emetic. Nitrous acid dissolves the butter of antimony; and when
an equal weight of nitrous acid has been three times distilled to
dryness from butter of antimony, the residuum, after ignition, is called
<i>bezoar mineral</i>, and seems to be little more than a calx of the metal.</p>

<p>Crude antimony, which has been much used in the experiments of
alchemists, is a combination of sulphur and regulus of antimony. Heat
melts it, and finally converts it into glass, of a dark red colour,
called <i>liver of antimony</i>. If antimony be melted or boiled with a fixed
alkali, a precipitate is made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
cooling, called <i>kermes mineral</i>, formerly used in medicine. The
antimonial preparations that are now most in use are <i>antimonial wine</i>
and <i>tartar emetic</i>. The wine is made by infusing pulverized glass of
antimony in Spanish wine some days, and filtering the clear fluid
through paper. The emetic tartar, or antimonial tartar, is a saline
substance, composed of acid of tartar, vegetable alkali, and antimony
partially calcined. The preparation may be seen in the Dispensaries.</p>

<p>The regulus of antimony is used in the form of pills, which purge more
or less in proportion to the acid they meet with; and as they undergo
little or no change in passing through the body, they are called
<i>perpetual pills</i>.</p>

<h3><i>Of Manganese.</i></h3>

<p>Manganese is a hard, black mineral, very ponderous, and the regulus of
it is a semi-metal of a dull white colour when broken, but soon grows
dark by exposure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to the air. It is hard and brittle, though not pulverizable, rough in
its fracture, and of very difficult fusion. Its calces are white when
imperfect, but black, or dark green, when perfect. The white calx is
soluble in acids. When broken in pieces, it falls into powder by a
spontaneous calcination, and this powder is magnetical, though the mass
was not possessed of that property. The black calx of manganese is
altogether insoluble in acids. It contains much dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p>The calx of manganese is used in making glass; the glass destroying the
colour of that of the other materials, and thereby making the whole mass
transparent.</p>

<p>This semi-metal mixes with most of the metals in fusion, but not with
mercury.</p>

<p>There is another ore of manganese, called <i>black woad</i>, which inflames
spontaneously when mixed with oil.</p>

<h3><i>Of Wolfram.</i></h3>

<p>Wolfram is a mineral of a brownish or black colour, found in the tin
mines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Cornwall, of a radiated or foliated texture, shining almost like a
metal. It contains much of the calx of manganese, and iron; but when the
substance is pulverized, these are easily dissolved, and the calx of
wolfram is found to be yellow.</p>

<p>This calx turns blue by exposure to light; and an hundred grains of it
heated with charcoal will yield sixty grains of a peculiar metal, in
small particles, which, when broken, look like steel. It is soluble in
the vitriolic or marine acids, and reduced to a yellow calx by nitrous
acid or aqua regia.</p>

<h3><i>Of Molybdena.</i></h3>

<p>Molybdena is a substance which much resembles plumbago; but its texture
is scaly, and not easily pulverized, on account of a degree of
flexibility which its laminæ possess. With extreme heat, and mixed with
charcoal, it yields small particles of a metal that is grey, brittle,
and extremely infusible; and uniting with several of the metals, it
forms with them brittle or friable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
compounds. By heat it is converted into a white calx.</p>

<h3><i>Of Solid Combustible Substances.</i></h3>

<p>There yet remains a class of solid substances, of the <i>combustible</i>
kind, but most of them have been already considered under the form of
the fluids, from which they are originally formed, as <i>bitumen</i>,
<i>pit-coal</i>, and <i>amber</i>; or under the principal ingredients of which
they are composed, as <i>sulphur</i> and <i>plumbago</i>.</p>

<p>There only remains to be mentioned the <i>diamond</i>, which is of a nature
quite different from that of the other precious stones, the principal
ingredient in which is siliceous earth, which renders them not liable to
be much affected by heat. On the contrary, the diamond is a combustible
substance; for in a degree of heat somewhat greater than that which will
melt silver, it burns with a slight flame, diminishes common air, and
leaves a soot behind. Also, if diamond powder be triturated with
vitriolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
acid, it turns it black, which is another proof of its containing
phlogiston.</p>

<p>The diamond is valued on account of its extreme hardness, the exquisite
polish it is capable of, and its extraordinary refractive power; for
light falling on its interior surface with an angle of incidence greater
than 24&frac12; will be wholly reflected, whereas in glass it requires
an angle of 41 degrees.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Doctrine of Phlogiston and the Composition of Water.</i></h3>

<p>It was supposed to be a great discovery of Mr. Stahl, that all
inflammable substances, as well as metals, contain a principle, or
substance, to which he gave the name of phlogiston, and that the
addition or deprivation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of this substance makes some of the most remarkable changes in bodies,
especially that the union of a metallic calx and this substance makes a
metal; and that combustion consists in the separation of phlogiston from
the substances that contain it. That it is the same principle, or
substance, that enters into all inflammable substances, and metals, is
evident, from its being disengaged from any of them, and entering into
the composition of any of the others. Thus the phlogiston of charcoal or
inflammable air becomes the phlogiston of any of the metals, when the
calx is heated in contact with either of them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Mr. Lavoisier and most of the French chemists, are of
opinion, that there is no such principle, or substance, as phlogiston;
that metals and other inflammable bodies are simple substances, which
have an affinity to pure air; and that combustion consists not in the
separation of any thing from the inflammable substance, but in the union
of pure air with it.</p>

<p>They moreover say, that water is not, as has been commonly supposed, a
simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
substance, but that it consists of two elements, viz. pure air, or
<i>oxygene</i>, and another, to which they give the name of <i>hydrogene</i>,
which, with the principle of <i>heat</i>, called by them <i>calorique</i>, is
inflammable air.</p>

<p>The principal fact adduced by them to prove that metals do not lose any
thing when they become calces, but only gain something, is, that mercury
becomes a calx, called <i>precipitate per se</i>, by imbibing pure air, and
that it becomes running mercury again by parting with it.</p>

<p>This is acknowledged: but it is almost the only case of any calx being
revived without the help of some known phlogistic substance; and in this
particular case it is not absurd to suppose, that the mercury, in
becoming precipitate per se, may retain all its phlogiston, as well as
imbibe pure air, and therefore be revived by simply parting with that
air. In many other cases the same metal, in different states, contains
more or less phlogiston, as cast iron, malleable iron, and steel. Also
there is a calx of mercury made by the acid of vitriol, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
cannot be revived without the help of inflammable air, or some other
substance supposed to contain phlogiston: and that the inflammable air
is really imbibed in these processes, is evident, from its wholly
disappearing, and nothing being left in the vessel in which the process
is made beside the metal that is revived by it. If precipitate per se be
revived in inflammable air, the air will be imbibed, so that running
mercury may contain more or less phlogiston.</p>

<p>The antiphlogistians also say, that the diminution of atmospherical air
by the burning of phosphorus is a proof of their theory; the pure air
being imbibed by that substance, and nothing emitted from it. But there
is the same proof of phosphorus containing phlogiston, that there is of
dry flesh containing it; since the produce of the solution of it in
nitrous acid, and its effect upon the acid, are the same, viz. the
production of phlogisticated air, and the phlogistication of the acid.</p>

<p>Their proof that water is decomposed, is, that in sending steam over hot
iron, inflammable air (which they suppose to be one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
constituent part of it) is procured; while the other part, viz. the
oxygene, unites with the iron, and adds to its weight. But it is
replied, that the inflammable air may be well supposed to be the
phlogiston of the iron, united to part of the water, as its base, while
the remainder of the water is imbibed by the calx; and that it is mere
water, and not pure air, or oxygene, that is retained in the iron, is
evident, from nothing but pure water being recovered when this calx of
iron is revived in inflammable air, in which case the inflammable air
wholly disappears, taking the place of the water, by which it had been
expelled.</p>

<p>In answer to this it is said, that the pure air expelled from the calx
uniting with the inflammable air in the vessel, recomposes the water
found after this process. But in every other case in which any substance
containing pure air is heated in inflammable air, though the inflammable
air be in part imbibed, some <i>fixed air</i> is produced, and this fixed air
is composed of the pure air in the substance and part of the inflammable
air in the vessel. Thus, if <i>minium</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
which contains pure air, and <i>massicot</i>, which contains none, be heated
in inflammable air, in both the cases lead will be revived by the
absorption of inflammable air; but in the former case only, and not in
the latter, will fixed air be produced. The calx of iron, therefore,
having the same effect with massicot, when treated in the same manner,
appears to contain no more pure air than massicot does.</p>

<p>Besides this explanation of the facts on which the new theory is
founded, which shews it to be unnecessary, the old hypothesis being
sufficient for the purpose, some facts are alledged, as inconsistent
with the new doctrine.</p>

<p>If the calx of iron made by water, and charcoal made by the greatest
degree of heat, be mixed together, a great quantity of inflammable air
will be produced; though, according to the new theory, neither of these
substances contained any water, which they maintain to be the only
origin of it. But this fact is easily explained upon the doctrine of
phlogiston; the water in this calx uniting with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
phlogiston of the charcoal, and then forming inflammable air; and it is
the same kind of inflammable air that is made from charcoal and water.</p>

<p>Also the union of inflammable and pure air, when they are fired together
by means of the electric spark, produces not pure water, as, according
to the new theory, it ought to do, but <i>nitrous acid</i>.</p>

<p>To this it has been objected, that the acid thus produced came from the
decomposition of phlogisticated air, a small portion of which was at
first contained in the mixture of the two kinds of air. But when every
particle of phlogisticated air is excluded, the strongest acid is
procured.</p>

<p>They find, indeed, that by the slow burning of inflammable air in pure
air, they get pure water. But then it appears, that whenever this is the
case, there is a production of phlogisticated air, which contains the
necessary element of nitrous acid; and this is always the case when
there is a little surplus of the inflammable air that is fired along
with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
pure air, as the acid is always procured when there is a redundancy of
pure air.</p>

<p>That much water should be procured by the decomposition of these kinds
of air, is easily accounted for, by supposing that water, or steam, is
the basis of these, as well as of all other kinds of air.</p>

<p>Since air something better than that of the atmosphere is constantly
produced from water by converting it into vapour, and also by removing
the pressure of the atmosphere, and these processes do not appear to
have any limits; it seems probable, that <i>water</i> united to the principle
of <i>heat</i>; constitutes atmospherical air; and if so, it must consist of
the elements of both dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air; which is a
supposition very different from that of the French chemists.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXX" id="LECTURE_XXX"></a>LECTURE XXX.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Heat.</i></h3>

<p>Heat is an affection of bodies well known by the sensation that it
excites. It is produced by friction or compression, as by the striking
of flint against steel, and the hammering of iron, by the reflection or
refraction of light, and by the combustion of inflammable substances.</p>

<p>It has been long disputed, whether the cause of heat be properly a
<i>substance</i>, or some particular affection of the particles that compose
the substance that is heated. But be it a substance, or a principle of
any other kind, it is capable of being transferred from one body to
another, and the communication of it is attended with the following
circumstances. All substances are expanded by heat, but some in a
greater degree than others; as metals more than earthy substances, and
charcoal more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
wood. Also some receive and transmit heat through their substance more
readily than others; metals more so than earths, and of the metals,
copper more readily than iron. Instruments contrived to ascertain the
expansion of substances by heat, are called <i>pyrometers</i>, and are of
various constructions.</p>

<p>As a standard to measure the degrees of heat, mercury is in general
preferable to any other substance, on account of its readily receiving,
and communicating, heat through its whole mass. <i>Thermometers</i>,
therefore, or instruments to measure the degrees of heat, are generally
constructed of it, though, as it is subject to become solid in a great
degree of cold, ardent spirit, which will not freeze at all, is more
proper in that particular case.</p>

<p>The graduation of thermometers is arbitrary. In that of Fahrenheit,
which is chiefly used in England, the freezing point of water is 32°,
and the boiling point 212°. In that of Reaumur, which is chiefly used
abroad, the freezing point of water is 0, and the boiling point 80. To
measure the degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
of heat above ignition, Mr. Wedgwood has happily contrived to use pieces
of clay, which contract in the fire; and he has also been able to find
the coincidence of the degrees in mercurial thermometers with those of
his own.</p>

<p>To measure the degrees of heat and cold during a person's absence, Lord
George Cavendish contrived an instrument, in which a small bason
received the mercury, that was raised higher than the place for which it
was regulated by heat or cold, without a power of returning. But Mr. Six
has lately hit upon a better method, viz. introducing into the tube of
his thermometer a small piece of iron, which is raised by the ascent of
the mercury, and prevented from descending by a small spring; but which
may be brought back to its former place by a magnet acting through the
glass.</p>

<p>Heat, like light, is propagated in right lines; and what is more
remarkable, cold observes the same laws. For if the substance emitting
heat without light, as iron below ignition, be placed in the focus
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a burning mirror, a thermometer in the focus of a similar mirror, placed
parallel to it, though at a considerable distance, will be heated by it,
and if a piece of ice be placed there, the mercury will fall.</p>

<p>Heat assists the solvent power of almost all menstrua; so that many
substances will unite in a certain degree of heat, which will form no
union at all without it, as dephlogisticated and inflammable air.</p>

<p>If substances be of the same kind, they will receive heat from one
another, in proportion to their masses. Thus, if a quantity of water
heated to 40° be mixed with another equal quantity of water heated to
20°, the whole mass will be heated to 30°. But if the substances be of
different kinds, they will receive heat from each other in different
proportions, according to their <i>capacity</i> (as it is called) of
receiving heat. Thus, if a pint of mercury of the temperature of 136 be
mixed with a pint of water of the temperature of 50, the temperature of
the two after mixture will not be a medium between those two numbers,
viz. 93, but 76; consequently the mercury was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
cooled 60°, while the water was heated only 26; so that 26 degrees of
heat in water correspond to 60 in mercury. But mercury is about 13 times
specifically heavier than water, so that an equal weight of mercury
would contain only one thirtieth part of this heat; and dividing 26 by
13, the quotient is 2. If <i>weight</i>, therefore, be considered, the heat
discovered by water should be reckoned as 2 instead of 60; and
consequently when water receives 2 degrees of heat, an equal weight of
mercury will receive 60°; and dividing both the numbers by 2, if the
heat of water be 1, that of the mercury will be 30. Or since they
receive equal degrees of heat, whether they discover it or not (and the
less they discover, the more they retain in a latent state) a pound of
mercury contains no more than one thirtieth part of the heat actually
existing in a pound of water of the same temperature. Water, therefore,
is said to have a greater capacity for receiving and retaining heat,
without discovering it, than mercury, in the proportion of 30 to 1, if
weight be considered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
or of 60 to 26, that is of 30 to 13; if <i>bulk</i> be the standard, though,
according to some, it is as 3 to 2.</p>

<p>The capacity of receiving heat in the substance is greatest in a state
of vapour, and least in that of a solid; so that when ice is converted
into water, heat is absorbed, and more still when it is converted into
vapour; and on the contrary, when vapour is converted into water, it
gives out the heat which it had imbibed, and when it becomes ice it
gives out still more.</p>

<p>If equal quantities of ice and water be exposed to heat at the
temperature of 32°, the ice will only become water, without receiving
any additional sensible heat; but an equal quantity of water in the same
situation would be raised to 178°, so that 146 degrees of heat will be
imbibed, and remain in latent in the water, in consequence of its
passing from a state of ice: and heat communicated by a given weight of
vapour will raise an equal weight of a nonevaporable substance, of the
same capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
with water, 943 degrees; so that much more heat is latent in steam, than
in the water from which it was formed.</p>

<p>This doctrine of latent heat explains a great variety of phænomena in
nature; as that of cooling bodies by evaporation, the vapour of water,
or any other fluid substance, absorbing and carrying off the heat they
had before.</p>

<p>Water, perfectly at rest, will fall considerably below the freezing
point, and yet continue fluid: but on the slightest agitation, the
congelation of the whole, or part of it, takes place instantly, and if
the whole be not solid, it will instantly rise to 32°, the freezing
point. From whatever cause, some motion seems necessary to the
commencement of congelation, at least in a moderate temperature; but
whenever any part of the water becomes solid, it gives out some of the
heat it had before, and that heat which was before latent becoming
sensible, and being diffused through the whole mass, raises its
temperature.</p>

<p>On the same principle, when water heated higher than the boiling point
in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
digester is suddenly permitted to escape in the form of steam, the
remainder is instantly reduced to the common boiling point, the heat
above that point being carried off in a latent state by the steam.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this wise provision in nature, the whole of any
quantity of water would, in all cases of freezing, have become solid at
once; and also the whole of any quantity that was heated to the point of
boiling, would have been converted into steam at once; circumstances
which would have been extremely inconvenient, and often fatal.</p>

<p>This doctrine also explains the effect of freezing mixtures, as that of
salt and snow. These solid substances, on being mixed, become fluid, and
that fluid absorbing much heat, deprives all the neighbouring bodies of
part of what they had. But if the temperature at which the mixture is
made be as low as that to which this mixture would have brought it, it
has no effect, and in a lower temperature this new fluid would become
solid; for that mixture has only a certain determinate capacity for
heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and if the neighbouring bodies have less heat, they will take from it.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that the comparative heat of bodies containing
phlogiston is increased by calcination or combustion; so that the calx
of iron has a greater capacity for heat, and therefore contains more
latent heat, than the metal.</p>

<p>In general it is not found, that the same substances have their capacity
for receiving heat increased by an increase of temperature; but this is
said to be the case with a mixture of ardent spirit and water, and also
that of spirit of vitriol and water.</p>

<p>Since all substances contain a greater or less quantity of heat, and in
consequence of being deprived of it become colder and colder, it is a
question of some curiosity to determine the extent to which this can go,
or at what degree in the scale of a thermometer any substance would be
absolutely cold, or deprived of all heat; and an attempt has been made
to solve this problem in the following manner. Comparing the capacity of
water with that of ice, by means of a third substance, viz.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
mercury, it has been found, that if that of ice be 9°, that of water is
10°; so that water in becoming ice gives out one tenth part of its whole
quantity of heat. But it has been shown, that ice in becoming water
absorbs 146 degrees of heat. This, therefore, being one tenth part of
the whole heat of water, it must have contained 1460 degrees; so that
taking 32 degrees, which is the freezing point, from that number, the
point of absolute cold will be 1426 below 0 of Fahrenheit's scale.</p>

<p>By a computation, made by means of the heat of inflammable and
dephlogisticated air, at the temperature of 50, Dr. Crawford finds, that
it contains nearly 1550 degrees of heat; so that the point of absolute
cold will be 1500 below 0. But more experiments are wanted to solve this
curious problem to entire satisfaction.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXXI" id="LECTURE_XXXI"></a>LECTURE XXXI.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Animal Heat.</i></h3>

<p>Since all animals, and especially those that have red blood, are much
hotter than the medium in which they live, the source of this heat has
become the subject of much investigation; and as the most probable
theory is that of Dr. Crawford, I shall give a short detail of the
reasons on which it is founded.</p>

<p>Having, with the most scrupulous attention, ascertained the <i>latent</i>,
or, as he calls it, the <i>absolute</i> heat of blood, and also that of the
aliments of which it is composed, he finds that it contains more than
could have been derived from <i>them</i>. Also finding that the absolute heat
of arterial blood exceeds that of venous blood, in the proportion of
11&frac12; to 10, he concludes that it derives its heat from the air
respired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
in the lungs, and that it parts with this <i>latent</i> heat, so that it
becomes sensible, in the course of its circulation, in which it becomes
loaded with phlogiston, which it communicates to the air in the lungs.</p>

<p>That this heat is furnished by the <i>air</i>, he proves, by finding, that
that which we inspire contains more heat than that which we expire, or
than the aqueous humor which we expire along with it, in a very
considerable proportion; so that if the heat contained in the pure air
did not become latent in the blood, it would raise its temperature
higher than that of red-hot iron. And again, if the venous blood, in
being converted into arterial blood, did not receive a supply of latent
heat from the air, its temperature would fall from 96 to 104 below 0 in
Fahrenheit's thermometer.</p>

<p>That the heat procured by combustion has the same source, viz. the
dephlogisticated air that is decomposed in the process, is generally
allowed; and Dr. Crawford finds, that when equal portions of air are
altered by the respiration of a Guinea pig, or by the burning of
charcoal, the quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of heat communicated by the two processes is nearly equal.</p>

<p>The following facts are also alleged in favour of his theory. Whereas
animals which have much red blood, and respire much, have the power of
keeping themselves in a temperature considerably higher than that of the
surrounding atmosphere, other animals, as <i>frogs</i> and <i>serpents</i>, are
nearly of the same temperature with it; and those animals which have the
largest respiratory organs, as birds, are the warmest; also the degree
of heat is in some measure proportionable to the quantity of air that is
respired in a given time, as in violent exercise.</p>

<p>It has been observed, that animals in a medium hotter than the blood
have a power of preserving themselves in the same temperature. In this
case the heat is probably carried off by perspiration, while the blood
ceases to receive, or give out, any heat; and Dr. Crawford finds, that
when an animal is placed in a warm medium the colour of the venous blood
approaches nearer to that of the arterial than when it is placed in
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
colder medium; and also, that it phlogisticates the air less than in the
former case; so that in these circumstances respiration has not the same
effect that it has in a colder temperature, in giving the body an
additional quantity of heat; which is an excellent provision in nature,
as the heat is not wanted, but, on the contrary, would prove
inconvenient.</p>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXXII" id="LECTURE_XXXII"></a>LECTURE XXXII.</h2>

<h3><i>Of Light.</i></h3>

<p>Another most important agent in nature, and one that has a near
connexion with heat, is <i>light</i>, being emitted by all bodies in a state
of ignition, and especially by the sun, the great source of light and of
heat to this habitable world.</p>

<p>Whether light consists of particles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
matter (which is most probable) or be the undulation of a peculiar
fluid, filling all space, it is emitted from all luminous bodies in
right lines.</p>

<p>Falling upon other bodies, part of the light is <i>reflected</i> at an angle
equal to that of its incidence, though not by impinging on the
reflecting surface, but by a power acting at a small distance from it.
But another part of the light enters the body, and is <i>refracted</i> or
bent <i>towards</i>, or <i>from</i>, the perpendicular to the surface of the new
medium, if the incidence be oblique to it. In general, rays of light
falling obliquely on any medium are bent as if they were attracted by
it, when it has a greater density, or contains more of the inflammable
principle, than the medium through which it was transmitted to it. More
of the rays are reflected when they fall upon a body with a small degree
of obliquity to its surface, and more of them are transmitted, or enter
the body, when their incidence is nearer to a perpendicular.</p>

<p>The velocity with which light is emitted or reflected is the same, and
so great that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
passes from the sun to the earth in about eight minutes and twelve
seconds.</p>

<p>Rays of light emitted or reflected from a body entering the pupil of the
eye, are so refracted by the humours of it, as to be united at the
surface of the retina, and so make images of the objects, by means of
which they are visible to us; and the magnifying power of telescopes or
microscopes depends upon contriving, by means of reflections or
refractions, that pencils of rays issuing from every point of any object
shall first diverge, and then converge, as they would have done from a
much larger object, or from one placed much nearer to the eye.</p>

<p>When a beam of light is bent out of its course by refraction, all the
rays of which it consists are not equally refracted, but some of them
more and others less; and the colour which they are disposed to exhibit
is connected invariably with the degree of their refrangibility; the
red-coloured rays being the least, and the violet the most refrangible,
and the rest being more or less so in proportion to their nearness to
these, which are the extremes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in the following order, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange,
red.</p>

<p>These colours, when separated as much possible, are still contiguous;
and all the shades of each colour have likewise their separate and
invariable degrees of refrangibility. When separated as distinctly as
possible, they divide the whole space between them exactly as a musical
chord is divided in order to found the several notes and half notes of
an octave.</p>

<p>These differently-coloured rays of light are also separated in passing
through the transparent medium of air and water, in consequence of which
the sky appears blue and the sea green, these rays being returned, while
the red ones proceed to a greater distance. By this means also objects
at the bottom of the sea appear to divers red, and so do all objects
enlightened by an evening sun.</p>

<p>The mixture of all the differently-coloured rays, in the proportions in
which they cover the coloured image above mentioned, makes a <i>white</i>,
and the absence of all light is <i>blackness</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
By means of the different refrangibility of light, the colours of the
rainbow may be explained.</p>

<p>The distance to which the differently-coloured rays are separated from
each other is not in proportion to the mean refractive power of the
medium, but depends upon the peculiar constitution of the substance by
which they are refracted. The <i>dispersing power</i> of glass, into the
composition of which <i>lead</i> enters, is great in proportion to the mean
refraction; and it is proportionally little in that glass in which there
is much alkaline salt. The construction of <i>achromatic telescopes</i>
depends upon this principle.</p>

<p>Not only have different rays of light these different properties with
respect to bodies, so as to be more or less refracted, or dispersed, by
them, but different sides of the same rays seem to have different
properties, for they are differently affected on entering a piece of
<i>island crystal</i>. With the same degree of incidence; part of the pencil
of rays, consisting of all the colours, proceeds in one direction, and
the rest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a different one; so that objects seen through a piece of this substance
appear double.</p>

<p>At the surface of all bodies rays of light are promiscuously reflected,
or transmitted.</p>

<p>But if the next surface be very near to it, the rays of one colour
chiefly are reflected, and the rest transmitted, and these places occur
alternately for rays of each of the colours in passing from the thinnest
to the thickest parts of the medium; so that several series, or orders,
of colours will be visible on the surface of the same thin transparent
body. On this principle coloured rings appear between a plane and a
convex lens, in a little oil on the surface of water, and in bubbles
made with soap and water.</p>

<p>When rays of light pass near to any body, so as to come within the
sphere of its attraction and repulsion, an <i>inflection</i> takes place; all
the kinds of rays being bent <i>towards</i>, or <i>from</i>, the body, and these
powers affecting some rays more than others, they are by this means also
separated from each other, so that coloured streaks appear both within
the shadow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the outside of it, the red rays being inflected at the greatest distance
from the body.</p>

<p>Part of the light which enters bodies is retained within them, and
proceeds no farther; but so loosely in some kinds of bodies, that a
small degree of heat is sufficient to expel it again, so as to make the
body visible in the dark: but the more heat is applied, the sooner is
all the light expelled. This is a strong argument for the materiality of
light. <i>Bolognian phosphorus</i> is a substance which has this property;
but a composition made by Mr. Canton, of calcined oyster-shells and
sulphur, in a much greater degree. However, white paper, and most
substances, except the metals, are possessed of this property in a small
degree.</p>

<p>Some bodies, especially phosphorus, and animal substances tending to
putrefaction, emit light without being sensibly hot.</p>

<p>The <i>colours</i> of vegetables, and likewise their <i>taste</i> and <i>smell</i>,
depend upon light. It is also by means of light falling on the leaves
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
other green parts of plants, that they emit dephlogisticated air, which
preserves the atmosphere fit for respiration.</p>

<p>It is light that imparts colour to the skins of men, by means of the
fluid immediately under them. This is the cause of <i>tanning</i>, of the
<i>copper colour</i> of the North Americans, and the <i>black</i> of the Negroes.
Light also gives colour to several other substances, especially the
solutions of mercury in acids.</p>

<h3><i>Of Magnetism.</i></h3>

<p>Magnetism is a property peculiar to iron, or some ores of it. The earth
itself, owing probably to the iron ores contained in it, has the same
property. But though all iron is acted upon by magnetism, <i>steel</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
only is capable of having the power communicated to it.</p>

<p>Every magnet has two poles, denominated <i>north</i> and <i>south</i>, each of
which attracts the other, and repels that of the same kind with itself.
If a magnet be cut into two parts, between the two poles, it will make
two magnets, the parts that were contiguous becoming opposite poles.</p>

<p>Though the poles of a magnet are denominated <i>north</i> and <i>south</i>, they
do not constantly, and in all parts of the earth, point due north or
south, but in most places to the east or west of them, and with a
considerable variation in a course of time. Also a magnet exactly
balanced at its center will have a declination from an horizontal
position of about 70 degrees. The former is called the <i>variation</i>, and
the latter the <i>dipping</i> of the magnetic needle.</p>

<p>A straight bar of iron which has been long fixed in a vertical position,
will become a magnet, the lower end becoming a north pole, and the upper
end a south one; for if it be suspended horizontally, the lower end will
point towards the north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and the upper end towards the south. Also any bar of iron, not
magnetical, held in a vertical position, will become a temporary magnet,
the lower end becoming a north pole, and the upper end a south one; and
a few strokes of a hammer will fix the poles for a short time, though
the position of the ends be changed. Magnetism may likewise be given to
a bar of iron by placing it firmly in the position of the
dipping-needle, and rubbing it hard one way with a polished steel
instrument. Iron will also become magnetical by ignition and quenching
it in water in the position of the dipping-needle.</p>

<p>Magnetism acts, without any diminution of its force, through any medium;
and iron not magnetical will have that power while it is in connexion
with a magnet, or rather the power of the magnet is extended through the
iron.</p>

<p>Steel filings gently thrown upon a magnet, adhere to it in a curious
manner; and the filings, acquiring magnetism by the contact, adhere
together, and form a number of small magnets, which arrange
themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
according to the attraction of the poles of the original magnet. This
experiment is made to the most advantage upon a piece of pasteboard, or
paper, placed over the magnet.</p>

<p>Magnetism is communicated by the friction, or the near position, of a
magnet to a piece of steel of a size less than it. For this reason a
combination of magnetical bars will have a greater effect than a single
one; and in the following manner, beginning without any magnetism at
all, the greatest quantity may be procured. Six bars of steel may be
rendered slightly magnetical by fixing each of them successively to an
upright poker, and stroking it several times from the bottom to the top
with the lower end of an old pair of tongs. If then four of these bars
be joined, the magnetism of the remaining two will be much increased by
a proper method of rubbing with them; and by changing their places,
joining the strongest, and acting upon the weakest, they may all be made
as magnetical as they are capable of being.</p>

<p>The strength of a natural magnet may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
be increased by covering its polar extremities with steel. This is
called the <i>arming</i> of the loadstone.</p>

<p>To account for the variation of the needle, Dr. Halley supposed the
earth to consist of two parts, an external <i>shell</i> and an internal
<i>nucleus</i>, detached, and having a revolution distinct from it; and that
the action of the poles of the shell and of the nucleus would explain
all the varieties in the position of the needle. But others think that
the cause of the magnetism of the earth is not <i>within</i>, but <i>without</i>
itself. One reason for this opinion is, that a magnet is liable to be
affected by a strong aurora borealis; and another is, that the variation
of the needle proceeds in such manner as supposes that the motion of the
nucleus must be quicker than that of the shell of the earth; whereas,
since it is most natural to suppose that motion was communicated to the
nucleus by the shell, it would be slower.</p>

<p>Some idea of the quantity and the progress of the variation of the
needle may be formed from the following facts.&mdash;At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Cape of Good Hope, when it was discovered by the Portuguese, in 1486,
there was no variation, the needle there pointing due north; in 1622 it
was about 2 degrees westward, in 1675 it was 8° W. in 1700 about 11° W.
in 1756 about 18° W. and in 1774 about 21&frac12;° W. In London, in
1580, the variation was 11 degrees 15 seconds E.; in 1622 it was 6° E.
in 1634 it was 4 deg. 5 min. E. in 1657 it was nothing at all; in 1672
it was 2 deg. 30 min. W. in 1692 it was 6 deg. W. in 1753 it was about
16 W. and at present it is about 21 W.</p>

<p>The longitude may in some places be found by the variation of the
needle; and Mr. Churchman, of America, having given much attention to
the subject, comparing the observations of others, and many of his own,
thinks that he has found a method of determining the longitude to a
great degree of certainty, in most cases, by this means.</p>

<p>He says there are two magnetic poles of the earth, one to the north and
the other to the south, at different distances from the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> poles of the earth, and revolving
in different times; and from the combined influence of these two poles
he deduces rules for the position of the needle in all places of the
earth, and at all times, past, present, or to come.</p>

<p>The north magnetic pole, he says, makes a complete revolution in 426
years, 77 days, 9 hours, and the south pole in about 5459 years. In the
beginning of the year 1777 the north magnetic pole was in 76 deg. 4 min.
north latitude; and in longitude from Greenwich 140 deg. east; and the
south was in 72 deg. south latitude, and 140 deg. east from Greenwich.</p>

<h3><i>Of Electricity.</i></h3>

<p>Electricity is a property belonging to, or capable of being communicated
to, all substances whatever; and whereas by some of them it is
transmitted with great ease, and by others with much difficulty, they
have been divided into two classes, and denominated <i>conductors</i> or
<i>non-conductors</i> of electricity. Also the latter receiving this power by
friction, and other means, are termed <i>electrics</i>, and the former
<i>non-electrics</i>.</p>

<p>Metals of all kinds, and water, are conductors, though in very different
degrees; so also is charcoal. All other substances, and also a perfect
vacuum, are non-conductors of electricity. But many of these substances,
when they are made very hot, as glass, resin, baked wood, and perhaps
all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the rest on which the experiment can be made in this state, are
conductors.</p>

<p>It is the property of all kinds of electrics, when they are rubbed by
bodies different from themselves, to attract light substances of all
kinds, to exhibit an appearance of <i>light</i>, attended with a particular
<i>sound</i>, on the approach of any conductor; and if the nostrils are
presented, they are affected with a <i>smell</i> like that of phosphorus.
This attraction is most easily explained by supposing that electricity
is produced by a fluid exceedingly elastic, or repulsive of itself, and
attracted by all other substances.</p>

<p>An electric exhibiting the appearances above mentioned, is said to be
<i>excited</i>, and some of them, particularly the <i>tourmaline</i>, are excited
by heating and cooling, as well as by friction. It appears, however,
that excitation consists in the mere transferring of electricity from
one substance to another, and that the great source of electricity is in
the earth. On this account it is necessary to the considerable
excitation of any electric, that the substance against which it is
rubbed (hence termed <i>the rubber</i>) have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
communication with the earth, by means of conductors; for if the rubber
be <i>insulated</i>, that is cut off from all communication with the earth by
means of electrics, the friction has but little effect.</p>

<p>When insulated bodies have been attracted by, and brought into contact
with, an excited electric, they begin to be repelled by it, and also to
repel one another; nor will they be attracted again till they have been
brought into contact with some conductor communicating with the earth;
but after this they will be attracted as at first.</p>

<p>If conductors be <i>insulated</i>, electric powers may be communicated to
them by the approach of excited electrics, or the contact of other
electrified bodies. They will then attract light bodies, and give
sparks, &amp;c. like the excited electrics themselves.</p>

<p>When electricity is strongly communicated to insulated animal bodies,
the pulse is quickened, and perspiration increased; and if they receive,
or part with, their electricity on a sudden, a painful sensation is felt
at the place of communication. But what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
is more extraordinary, is, that the influence of the brain and nerves
upon the muscles seems to be of an electric nature.</p>

<p>This is one of the last and most important of all philosophical
discoveries. I shall, therefore, give the result of all the observations
that have hitherto been made on the subject, in a <i>series of
propositions</i>, drawn up by an intelligent friend, who has given much
more attention to it than I have done.</p>

<p>1. The nerve of the limb of an animal being laid bare, and surrounded
with a piece of sheet lead, or of tinfoil, if a communication be formed
between the nerve thus armed and any of the neighbouring muscles, by
means of a piece of zinc, strong contractions will be produced in the
limb.</p>

<p>2. If a portion of the nerve which has been laid bare be armed as above,
contractions will be produced as powerfully, by forming the
communication between the armed and bare part of the nerve, as between
the armed part and muscle.</p>

<p>3. A similar effect is produced by arming a nerve and simply touching
the armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
part of the nerve with the metallic conductor.</p>

<p>4. Contractions will take place if a muscle be armed, and a
communication be formed by means of the conductor between it and a
neighbouring nerve. The same effect will be produced if the
communication be formed between the armed muscle and another muscle,
which is contiguous to it.</p>

<p>5. Contractions may be produced in the limb of an animal by bringing the
pieces of metal into contact with each other at some distance from the
limb, provided the latter make part of a line of communication between
the two metallic conductors.</p>

<p>The experiment which proves this is made in the following manner. The
amputated limb of an animal being placed upon a table, let the operator
hold with one hand the principal nerve, previously laid bare, and in the
other let him hold a piece of zinc; let a small plate of lead or silver
be then laid upon the table, at some distance from the limb, and a
communication be formed, by means of water, between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
limb and the part of the table where the metal is lying. If the operator
touch the piece of silver with the zinc, contractions will be produced
in the limb the moment that the metals come into contact with each
other. The same effect will be produced if the two pieces of metal be
previously placed in contact, and the operator touch one of them with
his finger. This fact was discovered by Mr. William Cruikshank.</p>

<p>6. Contractions can be produced in the amputated leg of a frog, by
putting it into water, and bringing the two metals into contact with
each other at a small distance from the limb.</p>

<p>7. The influence which has passed through, and excited contractions in,
one limb, may be made to pass through, and excite contractions in,
another limb. In performing this experiment it is necessary to attend to
the following circumstances: let two amputated limbs of a frog be taken;
let one of them be laid upon a table, and its foot be folded in a piece
of silver; let a person lift up the nerve of this limb with a
silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
probe, and another person hold in his hand a piece of zinc, with which
he is to touch the silver including the foot; let the person holding the
zinc in one hand catch with the other the nerve of the second limb, and
he who touches the nerve of the first limb is to hold in his other hand
the foot of the second; let the zinc now be applied to the silver
including the foot of the first limb, and contractions will immediately
be excited in both limbs.</p>

<p>8. The heart is the only involuntary muscle in which contractions can be
excited by these experiments.</p>

<p>9. Contractions are produced more strongly, the farther the coating is
placed from the origin of the nerve.</p>

<p>10. Animals which were almost dead have been found to be considerably
revived by exciting this influence.</p>

<p>11. When these experiments are repeated upon an animal that has been
killed by opium, or by the electric shock, very slight contractions are
produced; and no contractions whatever will take place in an animal that
has been killed by corrosive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sublimate, or that has been starved to death.</p>

<p>12. Zinc appears to be the best exciter when applied to gold, silver,
molybdena, steel, or copper. The latter metals, however, excite but
feeble contractions when applied to each other. Next to zinc, in contact
with these metals, tin and lead, and silver and lead, appear to be the
most powerful exciters.</p>

<p>At least two kinds of fishes, the <i>torpedo</i> and the <i>electrical eel</i>,
have a voluntary power of giving so strong a shock to the water in which
they swim, as to affect fishes and other animals which come near them;
and by a conducing communication between different parts of these
fishes, an electric shock may be given exactly like that of the Leyden
phial, which will be described hereafter; and if the communication be
interrupted, a flash of electric light will be perceived.</p>

<p>The growth of vegetables is also quickened by electricity.</p>

<h3><i>The same Subject continued.</i></h3>

<p>No electric can be excited without producing electric appearances in the
body with which it is excited, provided that body be insulated; for this
insulated rubber will attract light bodies, give sparks, and make a
snapping noise, upon the approach of a conductor, as well as the excited
electric.</p>

<p>If an insulated conductor be pointed, or if a pointed conductor,
communicating with the earth, be held pretty near it, little or no
electric appearance will be exhibited, only a light will appear at each
of the points during the act of excitation, and a current of air will be
sensible from off them both.</p>

<p>The effect of pointed bodies is best explained on the supposition of the
electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
matter in one body repelling that in another; and consequently the
electricity belonging to a body with a large surface making a greater
resistance to the entrance of foreign electricity than that belonging to
a smaller.</p>

<p>These two electricities, viz. that of the excited electric, and that of
the rubber, though similar to, are the reverse of, one another. A body
attracted by the one will be repelled by the other, and they will
attract, and in all respects act upon, one another more sensibly than
upon other bodies; so that two pieces of glass or silk possessed of
contrary electricities will cohere firmly together, and require a
considerable force to separate them.</p>

<p>These two electricities having been first discovered by producing one of
them from glass, and the other from amber, sealing-wax, sulphur, rosin,
&amp;c. first obtained the names of <i>vitreous</i> and <i>resinous</i>
electricity; and it being afterwards imagined that one of them was a
redundancy, and the other a deficiency, of a supposed electric fluid,
the former has obtained the name of <i>positive</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and the latter that of <i>negative</i>, electricity; and these terms are now
principally in use.</p>

<p>Positive and negative electricity may be distinguished from each other
by the manner in which they appear at the points of bodies. From a
pointed body electrified positively, there issues a stream of light,
divided into denser streams, at the extremities; whereas, when the point
is electrified negatively, the light is more minutely divided, and
diffused equally. The former of these is called a <i>brush</i>, and the
latter a <i>star</i>.</p>

<p>If a conductor not insulated be brought within the atmosphere (that is
the sphere of action) of any electrified body, it acquires the
electricity opposite to that of the electrified body, and the nearer it
is brought, the stronger opposite electricity does it acquire, till the
one receive a spark from the other, and then the electricity of both
will be discharged.</p>

<p>The electric substance which separates the two conductors possessing
these two opposite kinds of electricity, is said to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>charged</i>. Plates of glass are the most convenient for this purpose, and
the thinner the plate the greater is the charge it is capable of
holding. The conductors contiguous to each side of the glass are called
their <i>coating</i>.</p>

<p>Agreeably to the above-mentioned general principle, it is necessary that
one side of the charged glass have a communication with the rubber,
while the other receives the electricity from the conductor, or with the
conductor, while the other receives from the rubber.</p>

<p>It follows also, that the two sides of the plate thus charged are always
possessed of the two opposite electricities; that side which
communicates with the excited electric having the electricity of the
electric, and that which communicates with the rubber, that of the
rubber.</p>

<p>There is, consequently, a very eager attraction between these two
electricities with which the different sides of the plate are charged,
and when a proper communication is made by means of conductors, a flash
of electric light, attended with a report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
(which is greater or less in proportion to the quantity of electricity
communicated to them, and the goodness of the conductors) is perceived
between them, and the electricity of both sides is thereby discharged.</p>

<p>The substance of the glass itself in, or upon, which these electricities
exist, is impervious to electricity, and does not permit them to unite;
but if they be very strong, and the plate of glass very thin, they will
force a passage through the glass. This, however, always breaks the
glass, and renders it incapable of another charge.</p>

<p>The flash of light, together with the explosion between the two opposite
sides of a charged electric, is generally called the <i>electric shock</i>,
on account of the disagreeable sensation it gives any animal whose body
is made use of to form the communication been them.</p>

<p>The electric shock is always found to perform the circuit from one side
of the charged glass to the other by the shortest passage through the
best conductors. Common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
communicated electricity also observes the same rule in its transmission
from one body to another.</p>

<p>It has not been found, that the electric shock takes up any sensible
space of time in being transmitted to the greatest distances.</p>

<p>The electric shock, as also the common electric spark, displaces the air
through which it passes; and if its passage from conductor to conductor
be interrupted by non-conductors of a moderate thickness, it will rend
and tear them in its passage, in such a manner as to exhibit the
appearance of a sudden expansion of the air about the center of the
shock.</p>

<p>If the electric circuit be interrupted, the electric matter, during the
discharge, will pass to any other body that lies near its path, and
instantly return. This may be called the <i>lateral explosion</i>. The effect
of this lateral explosion through a brass chain, when the quantity of
electricity is very great, will be the discolouring and partial burning
of the paper on which it lies.</p>

<p>If a great quantity of electricity be accumulated, as in a <i>battery</i>,
the explosion will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
pass over the surfaces of imperfect conductors without entering them,
and the effect will be a strong <i>concussion</i> of the substance. Also the
electric matter thus accumulated and condensed will, by its repulsion,
form <i>concentric circles</i>, which will appear by melting the surface of a
flat piece of metal on which the explosion is received.</p>

<p>If an electric shock, or strong spark, be made to pass through, or over,
the belly of a muscle, it forces it to contract, as in a convulsion.</p>

<p>If a strong shock be sent through a small animal body, it will often
deprive it instantly of life.</p>

<p>When the electric shock is very strong, it will give polarity to
magnetic needles, and sometimes it reverses their poles.</p>

<p>Great shocks, by which animals are killed, are said to hasten
putrefaction.</p>

<p>Electricity and lightning are in all respects the same thing; since
every effect of lightning may be imitated by electricity, and every
experiment in electricity may be made with lightning, brought down
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

<h2><a name="LECTURE_XXXVI" id="LECTURE_XXXVI"></a>LECTURE XXXVI.</h2>

<h3><i>The same Subject continued.</i></h3>

<p>Three curious and important instruments, which are among the latest
improvements in electricity, deserve a particular explanation, and in
all of them the effect depends upon the general principles mentioned
above, viz. that bodies placed within the influence, or, as it is
usually termed, within the atmosphere, of an electrified body, are
affected by a contrary electricity, and that these two electricities
mutually attract each other. These instruments are the <i>electrophorus</i>,
the <i>condenser</i> of electricity, and the <i>doubler</i> of it.</p>

<p>The electrophorus consists of an insulated conducting plate applied to
an insulated electric. If the latter have any electricity communicated
to it, for example the negative, the positive electricity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
former will be attracted by it, and consequently the plate will be
capable of receiving electricity from any body communicating with the
earth; being, in this situation, capable of containing more electricity
than its natural quantity. Consequently, when it is removed from the
lower plate, and the whole of its electricity equally diffused through
it, it will appear to have a redundance, and therefore will give a spark
to any body communicating with the earth. Being then replaced upon the
electric, and touched by any body communicating with the earth, it will
be again affected as before, and give a spark on being raised; and this
process may be continued at pleasure, the electrophorus supplying the
place of any other electrical machine.</p>

<p>If the conducting plate of the electrophorus be applied to a piece of
dry wood, marble, or any other substance through which electricity can
pass but very slowly, or if the insulated conducting plate be covered
with a piece of thin silk, which will make some resistance to the
passage of electricity, and it be then applied to another plate
communicating with the earth; and if, in either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
of these cases, a body with a large surface possessed of a weak
electricity be applied to the conducting plate, the weak electricity not
being able to overcome the obstruction presented to it, so as to be
communicated to the other plate, will affect it with the contrary
electricity, and this reacting on the first plate, will condense its
electricity on that part of the plate to which it is contiguous; in
consequence of which its capacity of receiving electricity will be
increased; so that on the separation of the two plates, that electricity
which was before condensed, being equally diffused through the whole
plate, will have a greater intensity than it had before, attracting
light bodies, or even giving a spark, when the body from which it
received its electricity was incapable of it. For though it contained a
great quantity of electricity, it was diffused through so large a space
that its intensity was very small. This instrument is therefore called a
<i>condenser of electricity</i>.</p>

<p>If an insulated plate of metal possessing the smallest degree of
electricity be presented very near to another plate communicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
with the earth, it will affect this plate with the opposite electricity;
and this being, in the same manner, applied to a third plate, will put
it into the same state with the first. If then these two plates be
joined, and the first plate be presented to either of them, its own
electricity being attracted by that of the plate presented, that of the
other will be drawn into it, so that its quantity will be doubled. The
same process being repeated, will again double the electricity of this
plate, till, from being quite insensible to the most exquisite
electrometer, it will become very conspicuous, or even give sparks. This
instrument is therefore called a <i>doubler of electricity</i>, of excellent
use in ascertaining the quality of atmospherical electricity when ever
so small. If this instrument be so constructed that these three plates
can be successively presented to one another by the revolution of one of
them on an axis, it is called the <i>revolving doubler</i>; and in this form
it is most convenient for use.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
